> Alexey still grieves the loss of ▓▒▓▒░▒▓ and ▒▒▓▓░▒▓, and he has holes in his memory the size of Putorana Crater. May have been manipulation from his mother to make him fall in line, although if so, it wasn't very skilled. He retained all his memories of the Sump, and very few of his childhood, and you'd think she'd want the opposite. I have an alternative hypothesis, outlined below.
> 
> But first, a tangent: how much more evidence do I need that I've failed before I decide to actually act on it? After almost five decades of being called upon repeatedly to do it, I _still_ can't weigh human lives rationally and probabilistically. Leaving the Ryzhayas alive and in power puts the whole world in danger, and I still care more about the fate of this one boy, because I happened to know him. I've got to stop trying to bring him back. If I could capture him, maybe, _maybe_ I could deprogram him over the course of months, or even years, but by now that's so far from a reality that I can't afford to spend more resources on it. He and ▓▒▓▓▓▓▒ made it to Shtchavel House, and even if I assaulted that place personally I wouldn't be able to put a scratch on it, never mind capture Alexey alive. (And ▓▒▓▓▓▓▒ too, I suppose, but he's not a threat to world security the way Alexey is. He's no Ryzhaya, even if he lives in their house.) I'm really, truly sorry, Alexey. I want to keep looking for some other solution, because killing your enemies is almost _never_ the right thing to do, just the easy thing. But what else can I do? If I don't take you out, I'll be "murdering" all the people you kill, instead. Participating in a trolley problem isn't the same thing as murder.

> While trying to contact Alexey, I also found a girl called Sofia. Some sort of simulacrum of Alexey from a mirror world, but a girl. That doesn't make much sense to me, but admittedly I am not well-read in mirror magic. Did Alexey's mother create her out of pieces she tore out of Alexey? As a backup, maybe? As a better heir? Everyone knew she wanted her firstborn to be the heir. Alexey confided this in me many times himself. Strong evidence in favor of this hypothesis is that she seems to hold many of Alexey's missing memories of his childhood (but tweaked, to account for the fact that she's a girl). She's also missing memories of the period of time when Alexey was at the Sump; presumably Sofia Nikolaevna didn't want to give her memories of anything other than her grooming. It makes me more than a little ill to think about. To destroy a perfectly healthy boy and create an entirely new person, just to be your perfect heiress... but I suppose the latter half is what every monarch is trying to do. The Ryzhayas just have an utter lack of morals, and access to twenty generations of accumulated wealth in the form of the darkest and most toxic magic known to man.
> 
> I refuse to pity myself. I chose this, because of course I did, and I'm lucky to be in a position to be able to do anything about any of this. But even I have to admit that fighting monsters like these isn't as fulfilling as it's made out to be.
>
> One hopeful consequence of this, however, is that Alexey is now walking around with memories of essentially nothing but being with the Sump. In trying to create the perfect heiress in Sofia Pankratyevna, did Sofia Nikolaevna also create an antithesis in Alexey? An... anti-heiress? He'd make a hell of an enemy to the Ryzhayas, if only. He'd. Come. Back. Arghh, I have to stop thinking about this. I'll waste all my time fantasizing about bringing Alexey back and getting his help with taking the Ryzhayas down for good. But... I don't know, this whole memory/Sofia thing does change things. I don't know. We'll need more reconnaissance. I'll think about what I can do.
> 
> As for the other Ryzhayas, nothing's happened yet. Anna Pankratyevna is still in Petroport with her aunt, and hopefully she stays there. The Konopatovs are still in Abga; I managed to stop the letters that were sent out to them, but someone is bound to call them eventually, not to mention all the supernatural ways the Ryzhayas have of communicating. (Yet another reason to exterminate mosquitos. _Nobody_ will miss them.) The Yagins are still off the grid entirely, but Egor should return in a couple days and we'll know more.
> 
> I want to end this entry with something pithy, but I'm too tired. I'll just register my unhappiness one more time that things turned out this way with Alexey. I want my friend back.

"Sofia, is it okay if I handle this one?" asked Alexey.

Sofia looked at him in surprise. "Sure, but I thought you didn't want to talk about your experiences with the Sump yet?"

"I don't. I mean, I've warmed up to the idea a little since I said that, but I'm not gonna go into detail about the stuff I did there. I just wanna cover the basics."

Sofia shrugged, and slouched back in her chair. She gave a slight nod to Alexey that meant, _Alright, I'll trust you._

All eyes and ears were on Alexey, but he just shifted around in his seat. "Uh… um. How the hell do I even begin. Gimme a moment to get my thoughts all in a row."

His friends waited patiently and encouragingly.

"Okay, so," he began, "Every cult needs to have some kind of hook, right? Something really cool and, or, uh, genuinely helpful about them, that entices people to join? Well, the Sump's is… well, they have a couple, but the main thing, the thing that caused me and Artemis to join, as well as a bunch of the friends we made there, is transhumanism. They talk a lot about how they wanna use, like, advanced technology and stuff to… uh…"

"Tear my body apart atom for atom and rebuild it in my own image," finished Artemis. "That's not a quote. I made it up, years ago. I still feel that way. I felt that way _before_ I joined the Sump. Finding them was like… um… finding home. God, I wish there was a less clichéd way to say it. I was home."

Alexey bowed his head slightly to Artemis. There was a very deep well of pain that she was treading over in her words, and he wanted to support her. "The Sump members who aren't trans, like Pyotr Ivanovitch himself, mostly say it because they want to end death. Which is fair. Death sucks."

Everyone except Tosha nodded. "Wait, sorry," he asked. "Who's Pyotr Ivanovitch?"

"Pyotr Ivanovitch Lykov," explained Alexey, "Is the leader and founder of the Sump. He's… I have so, so much to say about him, because all of you have different ideas of this guy, and I want everyone on the same page. But, I guess for now, I'll just leave it at… he's a middle-aged man. He's got a beard and glasses. He talks and dresses like a university professor. He erases chalkboards with his sleeves instead of an eraser. He… he's a good teacher. I guess. He has a drum of human skin, and he thinks it makes him the most powerful shaman in Keleykh."

"Is he?" asked Vasilisa.

A short pause and a shrug. "Maybe?"

Katya Konstantinovna Narodova sat in her office at the Sump, poring over last week's schedule, and a mostly blank table that would become next week's. She would have greatly preferred to go out into the various lounges and socialize with other members, and she spent many hours most days doing just that, but as Pyotr's second in command, most day-to-day management tasks that didn't involve grand strategy fell to her. She took great pride in everything she could contribute, and couldn't rest comfortably until everything was typeset, printed, and filled out with a nigh-artistic degree of calligraphy, frequently involving the use of rulers and compasses in addition to her beloved mechanical pencil set. She could have written in pen, for all the mistakes she made. But she could not emotionally countenance the idea of committing to what might be a mistake, so she wrote in pencil, and kept an essentially sterile kneaded eraser that never needed replacing.

The main reason that the schedule needed to be done urgently was that there were four interviews scheduled for next week, for new members. Sump interviews were almost always group affairs, conducted in joint by Pyotr, Katya, and sometimes a stenographer, when Katya was too busy to take notes. Pyotr would want to be informed about the finalized interview times as soon as possible; the interviews were possibly his favorite activity. It warmed Katya's heart to see how happy it made him to meet new people, and she somewhat regretted her role as the "bad cop" in their good cop-bad cop interview routine. Nevertheless, she did not feel capable at all of projecting even a twentieth of the warmth that Pyotr did. If nothing else, she felt far too tired and beaten. Her cynicism was not an act.

Knocks came from her door. "Come in," said Katya.

It was Pyotr.

"Hey," he said. "Do you have time to discuss the Alexey situation?"

A new crease was added to Katya's brow. "Uh… Alexey Pankratyevitch?"

Pyotr nodded.

"Yeah," said Katya, dreading everything that was about to come next. "What do you need?"

"I need insight into his friend ▓▒▓▓▓▓▒," said Pyotr. "You're aware they've escaped to Shtchavel House together, right?"

"…Shtchavel House?"

"The Ryzhaya residence."

"Right, well," said Katya, "I was never on the best terms with ▓▒▓▓▓▓▒. I mean, we had a few friendly chats, sure, but once he made friends with ▓▒▓▒░▒▓, he was turned against me almost immediately. Not that he didn't keep trying to talk to me. I don't know why he bothered." She sounded bitter.

"Well… do you at least happen to remember what name ▓▒▓▓▓▓▒ is going by?"

"Artemis," said Katya. "And he's not using his patronymic, or his real surname. Not that he did when he was here, either." She looked Pyotr in the eyes, stern. "You didn't need to ask me for that. I passed down as much identifying information about him as I could to our scouts yesterday. He's possibly the most distinct individual in all of Keleykh."

"I'm not really here for his name," said Pyotr. "I want to know more about his _identity._ The name was just a segue."

"His identity? Do you want me to… to fucking explain transsexuality to you again, or what?" They had gotten to the part of the conversation that Katya had desperately hoped to avoid.

"Look, Katya," said Pyotr. "If I'm to fight Alexey, I'll be fighting his friends, too. And I know ▓▒▓▓▓▓▒… or, er, 'Artemis', is his closest friend. You knew her, and I didn't. Who _is_ she?"

"I told you, I don't have anything," said Katya icily. "Why don't you scry _him_ or look inside _his_ brain or something? This is your specialty."

"Katya." The word was all Pyotr needed to warn Katya to stop flouting his authority.

Katya crumpled up her face and buried it in her palms to massage it. A few tears came loose. She felt a stress headache developing.

"Fine," she said. "I'll explain to you who ▓▒▓▓▓▓▒ thinks this 'Artemis' is. Will you be satisfied if I do that?"

Pyotr nodded. "I will. Though, I'm surprised to see this reluctance from you. The most difficult thing a rationalist learns is to force themselves to confront difficult ideas directly, instead of shying away from them like everyone else. And you're among our strongest members. I _know_ you know how to do this. Is Artemis really so powerful that just the idea of her can defeat you?"

"First of all," snapped Katya, "Stop fucking calling her that. I mean, him. He's ▓▒▓▓▓▓▒. He's a man who's deluded himself into thinking women are the kind of people who'd seriously consider naming themselves after Greek goddesses. And that he's one of them."

"I concede that 'Artemis' is an unlikely name for a woman, but I don't think pagan goddesses really enter into the equation. After all, 'Diana' is a perfectly common name," observed Pyotr. "Overall, I find 'Artemis' inoffensive, and honestly a little cool."

Katya fixed an intense glare on Pyotr. "Because you're a _man._ It's exactly what a _man_ would come up with if he tried to pretend he knew anything about women."

"I seriously don't see why it matters so much to you," said Pyotr. "Sure, the pronoun stuff is counterintuitive, and there's the issue of bathrooms, but distinguishing between men and women is an _extremely_ low priority issue for the Sump. It has basically nothing to do with our mission at all. I can see—"

"Don't _DO_ this to me!" exploded Katya. "You—you of all people should see how _warped_ your model of the world has to be to misclassify yourself like this! Trans-so-called-women pattern with men in _every_ way. They take the jobs men take. They have the interests men have. They talk like men do! 'Male' and 'female' are _predictive categories._ Knowing who someone is is the only thing they're good for, so if someone goes and _lies_ about which category they belong to—"

"Katya," said Pyotr. "I get it. Really. I'm sorry I made light of it. You're right, transsexuals are not very good rationalists."

"They are _the_ reason—"

"_But,_" interrupted Pyotr, "I came here to learn about ▓▒▓▓▓▓▒. And I still don't know _anything_ about her. Him, sorry. Could you _please_ tell me about him? As an individual, not just as a transsexual."

"Those two are one and the same," replied Katya casually. "You can't separate transness out of someone's identity. It's like separating the hydrogens out of water. If you do, it's just not water anymore."

Pyotr didn't reply. He felt that if Katya kept talking, she might finally naturally meander from here onto the topic he'd asked for.
