> Alexey still grieves the loss of ▓▒▓▒░▒▓ and ▒▒▓▓░▒▓, and he has holes in his memory the size of Putorana Crater. Probably manipulation from his mother to make him fall in line.
> 
> I don't think he's coming back. I don't really know what to do with him. Have I just failed to save him? I don't want to face it, but leaving the Ryzhayas alive and in power puts the whole world in danger. I'm sorry, Alexey, but if I can't deprogram you, you're a negative term. I am not killing you; I am _un_-killing everyone whose deaths you would cause.
> 
> While trying to contact Alexey, I also found a girl called Sofia. Some sort of simulacrum of Alexey from a mirror world, but a girl. That doesn't make much sense to me, but admittedly I am not well-read in mirror magic. Did Alexey's mother create her? As a backup, perhaps? As a better heir? Everyone knew she wanted her firstborn to be the heir. Alexey confided this in me many times himself.
