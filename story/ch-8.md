> Alexey still grieves the loss of ▓▒▓▒░▒▓ and ▒▒▓▓░▒▓, and he has holes in his memory the size of Putorana Crater. May have been manipulation from his mother to make him fall in line, although if so, it wasn't very skilled. He retained all his memories of the Sump, and very few of his childhood, and you'd think she'd want the opposite. I have an alternative hypothesis, outlined below.
> 
> But first, a tangent: how much more evidence do I need that I've failed before I decide to actually act on it? After almost five decades of being called upon repeatedly to do it, I _still_ can't weigh human lives rationally and probabilistically. Leaving the Ryzhayas alive and in power puts the whole world in danger, and I still care more about the fate of this one boy, because I happened to know him. I've got to stop trying to bring him back. If I could capture him, maybe, _maybe_ I could deprogram him over the course of months, or even years, but by now that's so far from a reality that I can't afford to spend more resources on it. He and ▓▒▓▓▓▓▒ made it to Shtchavel House, and even if I assaulted that place personally I wouldn't be able to put a scratch on it, never mind capture Alexey alive. (And ▓▒▓▓▓▓▒ too, I suppose, but he's not a threat to world security the way Alexey is. He's no Ryzhaya, even if he lives in their house.) I'm really, truly sorry, Alexey. I want to keep looking for some other solution, because killing your enemies is almost _never_ the right thing to do, just the easy thing. But what else can I do? If I don't take you out, I'll be "murdering" all the people you kill, instead. Participating in a trolley problem isn't the same thing as murder.

> While trying to contact Alexey, I also found a girl called Sofia. Some sort of simulacrum of Alexey from a mirror world, but a girl. That doesn't make much sense to me, but admittedly I am not well-read in mirror magic. Did Alexey's mother create her out of pieces she tore out of Alexey? As a backup, maybe? As a better heir? Everyone knew she wanted her firstborn to be the heir. Alexey confided this in me many times himself. Strong evidence in favor of this hypothesis is that she seems to hold many of Alexey's missing memories of his childhood (but tweaked, to account for the fact that she's a girl). She's also missing memories of the period of time when Alexey was at the Sump; presumably Sofia Nikolaevna didn't want to give her memories of anything other than her grooming. It makes me more than a little ill to think about. To destroy a perfectly healthy boy and create an entirely new person, just to be your perfect heiress... but I suppose the latter half is what every monarch is trying to do. The Ryzhayas just have an utter lack of morals, and access to twenty generations of accumulated wealth in the form of the darkest and most toxic magic known to man.
> 
> I refuse to pity myself. I chose this, because of course I did, and I'm lucky to be in a position to be able to do anything about any of this. But even I have to admit that fighting monsters like these isn't as fulfilling as it's made out to be.
>
> One hopeful consequence of this, however, is that Alexey is now walking around with memories of essentially nothing but being with the Sump. In trying to create the perfect heiress in Sofia Pankratyevna, did Sofia Nikolaevna also create an antithesis in Alexey? An... anti-heiress? He'd make a hell of an enemy to the Ryzhayas, if only. He'd. Come. Back. Arghh, I have to stop thinking about this. I'll waste all my time fantasizing about bringing Alexey back and getting his help with taking the Ryzhayas down for good. But... I don't know, this whole memory/Sofia thing does change things. I don't know. We'll need more reconnaissance. I'll think about what I can do.
> 
> As for the other Ryzhayas, nothing's happened yet. Anna Pankratyevna is still in Petroport with her aunt, and hopefully she stays there. The Konopatovs are still in Abga; I managed to stop the letters that were sent out to them, but someone is bound to call them eventually, not to mention all the supernatural ways the Ryzhayas have of communicating. (Yet another reason to exterminate mosquitos. _Nobody_ will miss them.) The Yagins are still off the grid entirely, but Egor should return in a couple days and we'll know more.
> 
> I want to end this entry with something pithy, but I'm too tired. I'll just register my unhappiness one more time that things turned out this way with Alexey. I want my friend back.

"Sofia, is it okay if I handle this one?" asked Alexey.

Sofia looked at him in surprise. "Sure, but I thought you didn't want to talk about your experiences with the Sump yet?"

"I don't. I mean, I've warmed up to the idea a little since I said that, but I'm not gonna go into detail about the stuff I did there. I just wanna cover the basics."

Sofia shrugged, and slouched back in her chair. She gave a slight nod to Alexey that meant, _Alright, I'll trust you._

All eyes and ears were on Alexey, but he just shifted around in his seat. "Uh… um. How the hell do I even begin. Gimme a moment to get my thoughts all in a row."

His friends waited patiently and encouragingly.

"Okay, so," he began, "I can't speak for, like, their relative political power like Sofia can, 'cause I don't know the other factions all that well. But, she sounded like she was gonna say they're the most powerful, and, I mean… yeah. Keeping in mind my limited perspective… they're _nuts._ In every sense of the word.

"So, god, this requires a bit of background, because… so, the Sump is a cult, right? And it's built around one, really weird, specific view of the world. Which I guess is probably a normal thing for cults, but I dunno, really. I've only ever met the one. But, so like, Russians have been playing around with spirits now for like, twenty, thirty years, right? And they don't bind them the same way us natives do it, they just start with a blank slate and teach it whatever comes to mind. And in the past couple years suddenly they're this huge fad, and you can make lots of money off of Russians by saying you're gonna start a company that uses them, or something. Well, the Sump is Russian, and _very_ into spirits, but not quite like that. They figure…

"Okay, hold on, actually, so, this is a good place to introduce Pyotr Ivanovitch Lykov. _Pyotr Ivanovitch Lykov_ figures that there isn't really an upper limit to how powerful spirits can be, if you bind and train them correctly. And that scares the hell out of him, because then what if one day someone binds a spirit that can, I dunno, swallow the Sun? Either the guy _deliberately_ misuses it to kill everyone, or they give the spirit a poorly thought-out command and it does it on its own. He calls it, uh, the _exlex_. Latin for 'the lawless'. And, so… he built his whole cult around preventing the _exlex_ from coming into being. Okay, wait, I actually hate using his words. He built his whole cult around preventing this… counterfeit god from coming into being."

"Oh, wait. Is this an offshoot of the Cult of the Sky-Father?" asked Vasilisa. "I mean, they're trying to stop a fake god rather than worship it, but like, the similarities are there."

Alexey was about to begin, but got cut off by Sofia. "If I may handle this one: it's a misnomer to call any god 'fake'. No matter who you try to pray to, _someone_ will hear it, and they won't especially care what you call them or what rituals you use to pray to them. The Cult of the Sky-Father was an effort by indigenous Samoyeds to contact the Almighty God of the Christians, back when the Russians were forcing everyone to convert to Christianity at gunpoint. They expected both to tap into His power, and to make themselves acceptable to the Russians. They more or less succeeded, and yes, this may have contributed to Lykov's fear, but as far as we know he was never part of the Cult."

"Actually, he hates their guts," said Alexey.

Sofia raised an eyebrow.

"He feels that the Cult is just an attempt at being trendy, instead of a sincere search for power. It honestly just sounds like projection to me. Pyotr Ivanovitch's thing, I mean."

Sofia shrugged. "I think it's more about acceptance than power. But yes, I don't see why he expects them to have his goals."

"Well, okay, this is a good opportunity to get back on topic," said Alexey. "Because you sorta hit on the central problem with the Sump. Everyone in the Sump gets told, by Pyotr Ivanovitch himself, that they're _personally_ responsible for saving the whole damn world. We—_they_ get told that the only way to be a hero, or a good person, or anyone worth anything, is to make everyone and everything their responsibility, because if they don't, everyone will die, and that's murder. You know, I once heard a proverb:"

"'You can't burn yourself to keep someone else warm,'" recited Artemis, interrupting Alexey. She felt deeply connected to him through how much meaning this thought held to her, and she couldn't help but express it. Alexey only nodded.

"Yeah. You can't," said Alexey. "But the Sump asks you not only to burn yourself, it asks that you specifically toss yourself upon their great pyre. All these talented young people looking to change the world, and what does the Pyotr Ivanovitch tell them? 'Give me your money. Give me your spirits. Give me your reindeer. Give me everything, and then maybe, just maybe, we will have a chance.'" Alexey's words had started to drip with bitter tar, and the blood of old, deep wounds. His tone took on a different character entirely, as though an ancient Orthodox preacher were awakening within him. "And then he just _sits_ on his wealth! He does _nothing_ for his own cause! He has saved _no one_, and he has killed my friends. So, he has _failed_ utterly and his _evil_ and _laziness_ is laid bare for—"

"He also killed Mom," said Sofia, quietly.

"Well," said Alexey, caught off guard. He'd genuinely forgotten. "Mom was different."

"How?" Just a touch of animosity.

"My friends were broken by the Sump and driven to suicide. Our mother may have been seeking death, but that was not Pyotr Ivanovitch's doing."

"She was executed with a shot to the head by members of the Sump." A glare was forming on her face.

Alexey thought for a moment. His feelings about his mother were normally very complex, but at the moment, he just wanted to tell Sofia that in fact, killing their mother was the one thing that Pyotr Lykov had ever done right, and that she had deserved it completely. But some more sensible part of him fought against the idea, and in the end, all he could say was:

"Our mother was not my friend."

Sofia was disturbed into silence.

"So, anyway," began Alexey again, drifting back into his usual tone, "His actual plan is to get to it first. The big, powerful spirit, I mean. The Sump is supposed to be working on more sophisticated methods of binding spirits, so that one day they can bind some Ur-Spirit or other that will remake all of creation to be perfect. Or something."

"That's… a lot to unpack," said Vasilisa.

"Well, sure, it's a comic book supervillain plot," said Alexey. "But the Sump figure that if they can bind the spirit with enough ethics, and account for every possible loophole, the spirit will figure out on its own how to make the world better. It's not a terrible idea, on the face of it. People have been using spirits to improve their lives for who knows how long. Really, it's everything _else_ about their philosophy that make them so toxic. They…" His face darkened. "They don't have any limits. They encourage you to push past everything telling you can't do something, even your own body, because you are smarter and more responsible than everyone else and your body is only holding you back. It's a very attractive thought for anyone who's felt powerless and lost."

"Especially trans people," said Artemis. "That's pretty much how so many Sump members ended up dead. You've got a kid who feels like their existence is hopeless because they were born with the wrong body, right? So then instead of, you know, meeting older trans people who introduce them to the idea that they too can transition, they instead meet the Sump, who say they're going to change _everything,_ starting with bodies. And the kid has nothing to lose and everything to gain, so they go ahead and absorb all this insane Sump stuff about the imminent end of the world. And then, the Sump tells them…" She suddenly choked on her words. She had been delivering her piece perfectly casually, but this next thought was a solid wall of ice that demanded that she cry first before it would melt. She pressed on, hoarse. "The Sump tells them, 'What, a different gender? That's nonsense. You can't be a different gender. That's not _rational._'" She had to forcefully spit that last word out with all the accumulated venom of someone who had already fought a years-long war against the Sump. "That's the word they use to describe thinking like them. 'Rational.' Sump members are supposed to be 'rational.'"
