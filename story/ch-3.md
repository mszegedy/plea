The five kids stared at the newly reopened trunk of the car.

"So. Um. Yeah," clarified Artemis.

A boom resounded in the distance, the universally identifiable calling card of the Siberian Miners' Industrial Union, better known as Sibgorprom. Perhaps they were dealing with an abomination, as per usual. But perhaps…

"Fire," said Tosha. He pointed at the hills, in the exact direction of their former residence, at a bright flare of orange.

"…did the Gvezdins do that? Or did they have Sibgorprom nearby?" wondered Sofia out loud.

Alexey felt strangely at peace with the whole issue. "Whatever. That place was a shithole. If we've really got the Ryzhaya fortune on our hands, then we can buy twenty matchbox houses and still have money left over to feed us for the rest of our lives. All of us."

"We can't buy my notes back," Vasilisa responded sadly, still staring at the trunk.

The car's initial frantic descent down the hill had been a ballistic trajectory of sorts, and none of the open trunk's contents had been lost. But Sofia's subsequent ridiculous right turn that by all rights should have toppled the car, before it had shut the trunk, had caused absolutely everything to fly out of it, even the gigantic, furnace-sized, forty-kilogram storm kettle that had barely fit in in the first place. This included nearly all the worldly possessions of the Vasilisa and Tosha, and most of Artemis's save the car itself. This had only dawned on most of them now that they'd arrived at Shchavel House and opened the trunk back up to unpack. (Artemis, the most familiar with this problem thanks to her days as a sledge courier, had had a sinking feeling about it for the whole ride.)

Vasilisa had passed years of free time by making notes and drawings at home, sometimes of mathematics and science, sometimes of her friends, but most often of fictional worlds that she imagined. Her cargo had been clothes, a toothbrush, medication, makeup, about thirty small books of varying rarity, four fountain pens, and roughly a thousand sheets of paper inscribed with lists, maps, sketches, prose, and occasionally even isolated bars of music. All members of their group besides Alexey and Sofia had at least a few pages of personal writings or treasured letters and other documents to bring, but none of them had lost nearly as much as Vasilisa had.

"So? Write new ones," said Tosha. This earned them a glare from Vasilisa. "Sorry, I mean… you're really good at writing and drawing. You're still the same person as who wrote those notes. You can just write them again. Or write better ones. Either way. …sorry." Having expended his entire emergency cache of extra words for resolving hurt feelings, he awkwardly ambled in the direction of the front door of the house, perhaps with the intention of finding a way in.

Still somewhat hurt and not wanting to acknowledge any merit to Tosha's position out loud just yet, Vasilisa pondered their words in the privacy of her own mind. She was only barely familiar with the concept of Zen, but supposed it might apply here; it did feel like some kind of personal progress had been forged in the crucible of the disaster, a waning of her attachment to earthly possessions. Knowing that the truly valuable thing, herself, had not been lost, and that new notes were right there at the tip of the next pen she picked up, did make her feel better, and feel more powerful.

"…look, I'm sorry for everyone's losses, but are we just gonna stand out here like a bunch of idiots?" asked Artemis. "There's mosquitos."

"I meant what I said to the Gvezdins," said Sofia. "You should let them bite you. If we're going to do this together, then it wouldn't hurt for everyone to be in the good graces of the mosquitos."

"And if I get, like, HIV?" asked Vasilisa.

"Mosquitos don't—" started both Alexey and Artemis. "Sorry, go ahead," said Artemis.

"Mosquitos don't spread HIV," said Alexey. "Malaria, yes. Dengue, yes. West Nile, also yes. But not HIV. It doesn't spread into their spit, and the spit is what gets into your blood."

"…so what if I get malaria?" insisted Vasilisa.

"There's no malaria in Keleykh," said Alexey. "But just for you, if you do somehow get a bloodborne disease, my family has ways of exorcising it. In fact, we _want_ to meet as many disease spirits as possible. We can use them to protect ourselves. The reason nobody with two brain cells ever goes near this house is there's, like, a hundred of them already bound up in idols and stuff here."

"So, then, we've all got, what, either one brain cell or zero brain cells?" said Vasilisa. "I guess I'll just… shut up and get bitten. Sorry guys, can't talk, busy sharing my blood."

"Am I supposed to just get used to the itching, or what?" asked Artemis.

"Yes, you get used to it," assured Sofia.

"Bullshit, you absolutely do _not_ get used to the itching, that's _such_ a bald-faced lie," said Alexey. "But your body sort of reacts less over time. I don't think my mother's bites were even inflamed anymore."

"Says Alexey Pankratyevitch _Balandin_," said Sofia with a slight smile.

"Well, whatever. So, anyone got a key?" asked Artemis.

"Mom gave me one," said Sofia.

Alexey groaned. "Oh, goddammit. I'll go look around for a mirror so we can reverse it."

Sofia strode over to the door Tosha was fumbling with, and unlocked it in one practiced motion.

"Correction: Mom gave me _two_ keys," said Sofia. "Mirror images of each other."

"Okay, Alexey, I'm sorry about your childhood, but that's _fucking_ awesome," said Vasilisa.

"Oh, yeah," grumbled Alexey while lighting an oil lamp, "Making a _reversed key_ is so fucking cool. Not like just anyone can do that."

"Considering how much Sibgorprom hates us, I wonder how our family even got the metal for any of this," observed Sofia. "Maybe we have less notoriety in Norilsk?"

"You're going to have to catch us up on all the Ryzhaya lore over the next few days," said Artemis. "Most of what I know about Alexey's family I learned from the Sump, and I sure as hell don't trust that. You seem to be a little more, um… at peace… with your childhood than Alexey is."

Vasilisa was quickly running out of rail blocks at which to house her trains of thought, and feared that a collision was imminent. On the one hand, she was moving into a vast, new, and scary house, which she had dozens of comments on and questions about. Such as: _Boy, you weren't kidding, Alexey, there sure are a lot of idols here._ Or: why was the house's hearth cold, if Sofia Nikolaevna had been inhabiting it only hours prior? For that matter, where was her body, or the site of her murder? This second concern crossed over into a separate matter, namely that she was starting to feel very out of her depth regarding her place in the web of loose alliances that comprised Keleykh's magical underworld. Who exactly were the five of them now at war with? What were they capable of? Normally, she would be fascinated by these questions, but faced with the possibility of being _killed_ by any of the factions that came up among their answers, she was understandably dreading to learn more. And on another, entirely different hand:

"Norilsk probably doesn't care about Ryzhayas because they eat abominations and disease spirits for _breakfast,_" she blurted out. "I still dunno how they built it but there's no way they moved that much earth without just not caring about all the random stuff they freed."

It was one of Vasilisa's favorite subjects to give long lectures on. Norilsk was a miracle of modern engineering, so much so that there were numerous conspiracy theories (which Vasilisa kept abreast of but did not credit) regarding how it had actually been accomplished. Technically, "Norilsk" was metonymic for the 400 kilometer-wide Putorana Crater, a plateau that had been carved out of the surrounding mountains by forces scarcely within human comprehension. Directly at the crater's center sat the city of Norilsk, which directed strip mining operations on scales such that their yields could supply all of Russia and then some with earth, sand, metals, and dimension stone, obviating the need for mining elsewhere, and putting cryptic dents inside the crater that would have registered to any sane geologist as scars left in volcanic traps by glaciers, rather than the work of humans. The resulting lowlands were home to more than a few lakes and forests, whose seemingly paradoxical age fuelled rich debate on their origin among armchair scholars who had never so much as set foot in Siberia. A perhaps more reasonable claim in that field was that Sibgorprom's strict ban on mining elsewhere in Siberia, nominally to prevent the unearthing of more abominations, was motivated by a desire to protect Norilsk's monopoly on mining, to unknown and controversial ends.
