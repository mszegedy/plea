The five kids stared at the newly reopened trunk of the car.

"So. Um. Yeah," clarified Artemis.

A boom resounded in the distance, the universally identifiable calling card of the Siberian Miners' Industrial Union, better known as Sibgorprom. Perhaps they were dealing with an abomination, as per usual. But perhaps…

"Fire," said Tosha. He pointed at the hills, in the exact direction of their former residence, at a bright flare of orange.

"…did the Gvezdins do that? Or did they have Sibgorprom nearby?" wondered Sofia out loud.

Alexey felt strangely at peace with the whole issue. "Whatever. That place was a shithole. If we've really got the Ryzhaya fortune on our hands, then we can buy twenty matchbox houses and still have money left over to feed us for the rest of our lives. All of us."

"We can't buy my notes back," Vasilisa responded sadly, still staring at the trunk.

The car's initial frantic descent down the hill had been a ballistic trajectory of sorts, and none of the open trunk's contents had been lost. But Sofia's subsequent ridiculous right turn that by all rights should have toppled the car, before it had shut the trunk, had caused absolutely everything to fly out of it, even the gigantic, furnace-sized, forty-kilogram storm kettle that had barely fit in in the first place. This included nearly all the worldly possessions of Vasilisa and Tosha, and most of Artemis's save the car itself. This had only dawned on most of them now that they'd arrived at Shchavel House and opened the trunk back up to unpack. (Artemis, the most familiar with this problem thanks to her days as a sledge courier, had had a sinking feeling about it for the whole ride.)

Vasilisa had passed years of free time by making notes and drawings at home, sometimes of mathematics and science, sometimes of her friends, but most often of fictional worlds that she imagined. Her cargo had been clothes, a toothbrush, medication, makeup, about thirty small books of varying rarity, four fountain pens, and roughly a thousand sheets of paper inscribed with lists, maps, sketches, prose, and occasionally even isolated bars of music. All members of their group besides Alexey and Sofia had at least a few pages of personal writings or treasured letters and other documents to bring, but none of them had lost nearly as much as Vasilisa had.

"So? Write new ones," said Tosha. This earned them a glare from Vasilisa. "Sorry, I mean… you're really good at writing and drawing. You're still the same person as who wrote those notes. You can just write them again. Or write better ones. Either way. …sorry." Having expended his entire emergency cache of extra words for resolving hurt feelings, he awkwardly ambled in the direction of the front door of the house, perhaps with the intention of finding a way in.

Still somewhat hurt and not wanting to acknowledge any merit to Tosha's position out loud just yet, Vasilisa pondered their words in the privacy of her own mind. She was only barely familiar with the concept of Zen, but supposed it might apply here; it did feel like some kind of personal progress had been forged in the crucible of the disaster, a waning of her attachment to earthly possessions. Knowing that the truly valuable thing, herself, had not been lost, and that new notes were right there at the tip of the next pen she picked up, did make her feel better, and feel more powerful.

"…look, I'm sorry for everyone's losses, but are we just gonna stand out here like a bunch of idiots?" asked Artemis. "There's mosquitos."

"I meant what I said to the Gvezdins," said Sofia. "You should let them bite you. If we're going to do this together, then it wouldn't hurt for everyone to be in the good graces of the mosquitos."

"And if I get, like, HIV?" asked Vasilisa.

"Mosquitos don't—" started both Alexey and Artemis. "Sorry, go ahead," said Artemis.

"Mosquitos don't spread HIV," said Alexey. "Malaria, yes. Dengue, yes. West Nile, also yes. But not HIV. It doesn't spread into their spit, and the spit is what gets into your blood."

"…so what if I get malaria?" insisted Vasilisa.

"There's no malaria in Keleykh," said Alexey. "But just for you, if you do somehow get a bloodborne disease, my family has ways of exorcising it. In fact, we _want_ to meet as many disease spirits as possible. We can use them to protect ourselves. The reason nobody with two brain cells ever goes near this house is there's, like, a hundred of them already bound up in idols and stuff here."

"So, then, we've all got, what, either one brain cell or zero brain cells?" said Vasilisa. "I guess I'll just… shut up and get bitten. Sorry guys, can't talk, busy sharing my blood."

"Am I supposed to just get used to the itching, or what?" asked Artemis.

"Yes, you get used to it," assured Sofia.

"Bullshit, you absolutely do _not_ get used to the itching, that's _such_ a bald-faced lie," said Alexey. "But your body sort of reacts less over time. I don't think my mother's bites were even inflamed anymore."

"Says Alexey Pankratyevitch _Balandin_," said Sofia with a slight smile.

"Well, whatever. So, anyone got a key?" asked Artemis.

"Mom gave me one," said Sofia.

Alexey groaned. "Oh, goddammit. I'll go look around for a mirror so we can reverse it."

Sofia strode over to the door Tosha was fumbling with, and unlocked it in one practiced motion.

"Correction: Mom gave me _two_ keys," said Sofia. "Mirror images of each other."

"Okay, Alexey, I'm sorry about your childhood, but that's _fucking_ awesome," said Vasilisa, walking inside.

"Oh, yeah," grumbled Alexey while trying to find the oil lamp he knew should be on the table immediately inside the doorway, "Making a _reversed key_ is so fucking cool. Not like just anyone can do that."

"Considering how much Sibgorprom hates us, I wonder how our family even got the metal for any of this," observed Sofia. "Maybe we have less notoriety in Norilsk?"

"You're going to have to catch us up on all the Ryzhaya lore over the next few days," said Artemis, as Alexey lit the oil lamp. "Most of what I know about Alexey's family I learned from the Sump, and I sure as hell don't trust that. You seem to be a little more, um… at peace… with your childhood than Alexey is."

Vasilisa was quickly running out of rail blocks at which to house her trains of thought, and feared that a collision was imminent. On the one hand, she was moving into a vast, new, and scary house, which she had dozens of comments on and questions about. Such as: _Boy, you weren't kidding, Alexey, there sure are a lot of idols here._ Or: why was the house's hearth cold, if Sofia Nikolaevna had been inhabiting it only hours prior? For that matter, where was her body, or the site of her murder? This second concern crossed over into a separate matter, namely that she was starting to feel very out of her depth regarding her place in the web of loose alliances that comprised Keleykh's magical underworld. Who exactly were the five of them now at war with? What were they capable of? Normally, she would be fascinated to hear the answers to these questions, but faced with the fact that they comprised a list of people who would probably gladly see her and her friends dead, she felt understandably more somber about the topic than usual. And on another, entirely different hand, there was the thought she'd been holding her breath to deliver since Sofia brought it up:

"Norilsk probably doesn't care about Ryzhayas because they eat abominations and disease spirits for _breakfast,_" she blurted out. "I still dunno how they built it but there's no way they moved that much earth without just not caring about all the random stuff they freed."

It was one of Vasilisa's favorite subjects to give long lectures on. Norilsk was a miracle of modern engineering, so much so that there were numerous conspiracy theories (which Vasilisa kept abreast of but did not credit) regarding how it had actually been accomplished. Technically, "Norilsk" was metonymic for the 400 kilometer-wide Putorana Crater, a plateau that had been carved out of the surrounding Peykovy Mountains by forces scarcely within human comprehension. Directly at the crater's center sat the city of Norilsk, which directed strip mining operations on scales such that their yields could supply all of Russia and then some with earth, sand, metals, and dimension stone, obviating the need for mining elsewhere, and etching cryptic dents in the crater that would have registered to any sane geologist as scars left in volcanic traps by glaciers, rather than the work of humans. The resulting lowlands were home to more than a few lakes and forests, whose seemingly paradoxical age fuelled rich debate on their origin among armchair scholars who had never so much as set foot in Siberia. A perhaps more reasonable source of doubt in that field was Sibgorprom's strict ban on mining elsewhere in Siberia, which while nominally to prevent the unearthing of more abominations, was routinely accused of being motivated by a desire to protect Norilsk's monopoly on mining, to unknown or controversial ends. Vasilisa, on her part, just longed to visit the crater's edge one day, to see where sheer vertical facets had been hewn out of mountains, cutting them in half, visceral proof of some higher power's hand.

All this and so much more was on the tip of her tongue, but she managed to hold it in so that she could take in the scenery instead. From the outside, Shchavel House was a large box that could have been mistaken for a small hotel or hospital, with elaborate concrete paneling forming pastel stripes of multiple primary colors, and three storeys of windows, capped off by gently sloping, ruby red roof tiles. But seeing it from the inside was an altogether different matter.

"Is the _entire house_ a library?" wondered Artemis aloud. "_How_ has this house not burnt down yet? No offense, Alyosha, but if I hated everything your family stood for and wanted to destroy everything you had, it would take me a can of kerosene and about five minutes. I can't see a _single_ wall that isn't covered in books and idols."

Sofia grinned. "If you actually tried that, the first spirit you came across here would skin you alive. Then, another would turn all your fat into lichen, and your muscles into mushrooms. Then we'd use your kerosene to light our lamps, and feed you to our reindeer."

Disturbed, Artemis shot back, "You don't _have_ reindeer. What kind of super-rich family doesn't even have reindeer?"

"Okay, guys, cool it," said Alexey. "First thing's first. We light the hearth. We're all cold and tired, and I don't think Sofia even dried off after the broken sink got her wet. We can go over… Ryzhaya lore… and whatever after we're all situated. Sofia: Tosha and I are going to light the hearth. In the meantime, could you please show Artemis and Vasilisa where they can stay? And light all the lamps along the way."

"It's _my_ house. _I'll_ light the hearth. You can show everyone to their rooms."

Alexey ground his teeth. "It's _our_ house. And legally, it's _my_ house, and if you have _any_ plans to take it away from me and my friends, I'm afraid you won't be able to. Even the guys who want us dead agree. It's mine."

Sofia shifted a bit, uncomfortable. "Okay, okay… I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. I don't want you to think I'm you or your friends' enemy, and I definitely don't want to take the house, or the Ryzhaya fortune, for that matter, away from you. It's just that I was told my whole life I'd get to be the heiress, and I'd get to light the hearth. It's important to me. I want to light it because I want to show everyone that they're welcome in my home, and that I… want them to feel alright. Want them alive."

Alexey was silent for a bit. "One of my parents' favorite insults was that I'm a waste of firewood. Especially my mother. She said that all the time when she felt like I wasn't being useful enough to her."

Sofia gave a small, sad smile. "Yeah, same. That's exactly what I mean. I want to show your friends that they're not at all a waste of firewood."

"Yeah. Okay. You get the hearth, then. Which room do you want?"

"Third room on the left of the second floor."

"Seriously? You still want our old room? I figured you'd want to move into our… into Mom's room."

"No way. I'd have to de-Mom it first. Who knows what creepy stuff she kept in there?"

Vasilisa couldn't hold the question in for any longer. "Uh, speaking of creepy stuff. Is your… is your mom still here? I mean, her body?"

Sofia didn't move a muscle, but her eyes suddenly seemed far more distant. "Not a chance. The murderers couldn't have set foot within half a kilometer of this place. She was captured downtown, taken to the seashore, and executed. Her body was taken out to the sea ice, on a sledge, and left there."

"I'm afraid to ask, but… how do you know?" asked Artemis.

"I was there."

An uncomfortable silence followed. After enough of it had elapsed, Tosha decided that as the one least sensitive to social tension, they should be the one to break it.

"I'm really sorry to hear that," he said. "That sounds traumatic."

"…how did you escape?" asked Vasilisa.

"My mom turned me into a lemming earlier yesterday, and put me in her coat pocket," explained Sofia. “I was in the pocket the whole time. By the time I came out, her body was abandoned on the sea ice, in the Kingdom of the Dead. The wind carried her voice, and told me where to find Alexey. I ran home across the ice, turned back into a human, and sought him out."

The three non-Ryzhayas looked at each other. No element of this story was grounded in the common reality they'd been living in their whole lives. Not even Artemis had heard of magic like this outside of folktales, for all her apprenticeship under the man who billed himself as Keleykh's most powerful shaman. She supposed she'd never gotten deep enough into the Sump.

"What was it like, being a lemming?" asked Vasilisa.

"Scary," said Sofia. "I think lemmings naturally assume they're in a fox's mouth, if they're in a tight, warm space against a larger mammal's body. The whole time, I was ready to escape the moment I thought it was safe. I ended up chewing my way out."

"Oh," said Vasilisa, "I was hoping it would have been more fun. I've always wanted to try being an animal."

Sofia smiled. "We can arrange that."

Alexey, who'd been ruminating during the discussion and cataloguing the different sorts of smiles his sister seemed to use to communicate her emotions, finally spoke. "I'm sorry, Sofia. Thank you for sharing. You don't have to talk about it again, if you don't want to. How about we all get our minds off it by doing all that stuff we said we were gonna do around the house?"

There was a chorus of mumbled affirmations, and the group split. Sofia wandered in the direction of the ground-floor hearth, oil lamp in hand. (A house this big did not have merely a single hearth, after all, and Sofia's intent was to light all four.) Meanwhile, Alexey led the rest of the gang upstairs to the second floor guest rooms, armed with a box of matches.
