"Deer."

While Keleykh's downtown enjoyed basic electric lighting, its hills had to make do with moonlight filtered through pine needles. Artemis's car brought a new and foreign element to the scene: piercing blue-white fluorescent headlights, imported from Japan. Aggressive, invasive predators situated in a much more delicate ecosystem than they had come from, their current victim was the terrified wild reindeer that Tosha had just pointed out.

Artemis swerved around it, her headlights momentarily illuminating stray, naked concrete staircases among the pine trees in the countryside, and a portion of a large, partially buried sphere whose tarnished metal still glared back at her in places despite untold centuries of lichen growth obscuring most of its sheen. Much of the landscape in Keleykh's suburbs remained undeveloped, partially due to politics, and partially due to the inconvenience of dealing with these structures whose express purpose often seemed to be to obstruct settlement, covering all surveyed land in Siberia. It was nothing that new theories of architecture couldn't fix, however, and any Siberian architect, by this late age, had pored over at least one book describing how to build stable houses and roads on fields of concrete rubble deep enough to invade multiple soil strata, or on mountains of empty steel drums. It merely came with the territory. Not that it wasn't still massively expensive for any structure more complicated than a tent.

Most of the passengers were uncomfortable with even short two-person excursions by car, concerned about the stability of a vehicle that travelled at these speeds by some means other than a pair of rails. Certainly, the first sheets of ice of the winter had already been lain on the roads over the past October, inherited from a mixture of frozen slush and rain. With all five of them packed into the car at once, their adrenaline heightened by the panicked yelling that had sent them there in the first place, it was hard for anyone to trust that Artemis had the titanic, alien machine under control, least of all for her.

"Um. Are we driving on the wrong side of the road?" asked Sofia.

"No, this car just has the steering wheel on the wrong side. It's an import," said Alexey from the passenger seat.
