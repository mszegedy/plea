"Deer."

While Keleykh's downtown enjoyed basic electric lighting, its hills had to make do with moonlight filtered through pine needles. Artemis's car brought a new and foreign element to the scene: piercing blue-white fluorescent headlights, imported from Japan. Aggressive, invasive predators situated in a much more delicate ecosystem than they had come from, their current victim was the terrified wild reindeer that Tosha had just pointed out.

Artemis swerved around it, her headlights momentarily illuminating stray, naked concrete staircases among the pine trees in the countryside, and a portion of a large, partially buried sphere whose tarnished metal still glared back at her in places despite untold centuries of lichen growth obscuring most of its sheen. Much of the landscape in Keleykh's suburbs remained undeveloped, partially due to politics, and partially due to the inconvenience of dealing with these structures whose express purpose often seemed to be to obstruct settlement, covering all surveyed land in Siberia. It was nothing that new theories of architecture couldn't fix, however, and any Siberian architect, by this late age, had pored over at least one book describing how to build stable houses and roads on fields of concrete rubble deep enough to invade multiple soil strata, or on mountains of empty steel drums. It merely came with the territory. Not that it wasn't still massively expensive for any structure more complicated than a tent.

Most of the passengers were uncomfortable with even short two-person excursions by car, concerned about the stability of a vehicle that travelled at these speeds by some means other than a pair of rails. Certainly, the first sheets of ice of the winter had already been lain on the roads over the past October, inherited from a frozen mixture of slush and rain. With all five people packed into the car at once, their adrenaline heightened by the panicked yelling that had sent them there in the first place, it was hard for anyone to trust that Artemis had the titanic, alien machine under control, least of all for her.

"Um. Are we driving on the wrong side of the road?" asked Sofia.

"No, this car just has the steering wheel on the wrong side. It's an import," said Alexey from the passenger seat.

"Yeah, that's… not what I mean. Shouldn't we be on the right?"

"…aren't we? We are."

"Oh… I guess it's a mirror thing. This side of the road looks like the left for me."

Alexey pressed his hands into his face to relieve some stress, and recoiled. They smelled of blood. Breaking the mirror had been heroic, but dangerous.

So Sofia saw the world backwards. Or thought of it backwards. Did she also taste and smell it backwards? He thought of how he could test that. He would need…

"I'll get you some peppermint to chew on," said Artemis, finishing Alexey's thought. "If it tastes like spearmint, you're mirrored relative to us, which is gonna be a pain in the ass if we're gonna have to feed you, because we don't have mirrored food. If it tastes like peppermint then everything's okay. Uh, I guess I shouldn't have told you in advance which is which, but hopefully that won't affect the outcome."

"…I've never really been good at telling apart mint, but I'll try."

"Well, it might taste more like caraway or dill anyway. Maybe I should get you one of those instead and see if it tastes like peppermint."

"Deer. Three," said Tosha. They were visible on the side of the road, a ways up ahead. Artemis slowed down.

The deer took this as a cue to cross the road, but, unusually, stopped in the middle, barricading the way forward in an almost military row formation.

"Fuck," groaned Artemis. She honked. This stirred up some birds, but the deer remained in place, eyeing the car curiously.

"Yeah, we don't have time for this," said Alexey. He got out of the car, and started waving both arms animatedly, approaching the deer. "Hey! Get the fuck out of the way! This is our road! Fuck off! Get lost!"

The deer closest to him took a few steps in his direction, appeared to think for a moment, then lowered its horns and charged straight at him, knocking him onto the ice. His head bounced off a frozen puddle and put a dent in it. Alexey went limp.

"Shit, fuck! Vasilisa, you're on the right side to haul… are you _sleeping?_"

She was not sleeping. Vasilisa was frozen with anxiety. There was a fine line between high-stress situations that put her into action, and high-stress situations that made her shut down. Ever since she'd gotten into the car, this one had been the latter.

"I'll do it," said Sofia hurriedly. She climbed over Vasilisa and opened the lefthand back door, just in time to accidentally block another charge from the reindeer. Its horn shattered the window, and the deer tripped and fell over, lodged awkwardly into the window frame. Artemis, Sofia, and Tosha all yelped. Vasilisa sank into her seat.

"Augh, you _asshole!_ You know how long that's going to take to fix?" yelled Artemis.

Sofia started tearing up. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry…"

"What, no, Sofia, not you. I'm talking to the deer. Fuck _you,_ stupid animal," Artemis said, pointing at the deer for emphasis.

The deer metamorphosed into a man, who stood up. He had short, black hair, and the aged, angular, sort of gaunt face where it was hard to tell if the dents were scars and formerly broken bones, or if they were natural contours. He wore an expensive-looking longcoat of black dyed cotton and brass buttons, and matching leather gloves and boots.

"My apologies, ▓▒▓▓▓▓▒ Ilyitch. It was an accident. I am only here to apprehend the Ryzhaya," he said to Artemis, in a tone that was clearly trying to be suave but was somewhat undercut by his quiet, reedy voice.

"Wait, what? Artemis, do you know this idiot?" Vasilisa finally found the strength to speak.

"…yeah. Hi, Nikolay Nikolaevitch. What do you want with my friend?"

"The Sump has decreed that the time of the Ryzhayas is at an end, and the Keleykhsky council agrees. The whole town is looking for him. He is the only Ryzhaya left alive in Keleykh, now that we have executed his mother."

Artemis had only met Alexey's mother once. She had seemed deceptively affable to her, but the effect she'd had on Alexey, both in the moment and on the long term, was far more telling. She could not find it in her to care that Sofia Nikolaevna was gone. She wondered if Alexey would, unaware that he'd already heard the news from a different source.

"Well… what makes you think you're going to be able to take him? I have a car. What do you have?"

"We are Gvezdins. That, over there, the one with the short but very branched antlers, is my younger brother, Kostya. The other one, with the darker grey coat, is my cousin Alexey Arkadyevitch. All three of us have the favor of the Sun-Mother. Should we ask for it, all the metal in your car will return to the stars it once came from."

Artemis considered. Magic had only recently achieved widespread popularity in Keleykh, and the average person had, at best, a single idol-spirit to ask questions of and request assistance from, a power whose full implications had yet to be understood or taken advantage of by most people. Artemis and her friends didn't even have that, partly out of leftover habit from her and Alexey's time with the Sump, a powerful cult that heavily controlled the usage of spirits and people's relationships with them. Having the favor of a goddess was a nearly meaningless boast to her; the only religious person she'd ever known was Alexey, and the Moon-Mother had never seemed to do anything in return for his erstwhile devotion. Hearing the Gvezdin family name meant even less to her, except that she knew they were important to the Sump.

"…okay? Try it, I guess," she said. "While you're doing that, I'll run you and your two guys over."

"Wait."

Sofia got out of the car, shutting the door behind her, and put herself between Alexey and Nikolay Nikolaevitch.

"Alexey is not the only Ryzhaya left in Keleykh," she said.

Feeling more secure with all the car's doors closed and unhindered, Artemis calculated the possible costs and benefits of just hitting the gas like she'd threatened. She couldn't see Alexey's body from where she sat, so she was wary of moving the car much, and she wasn't sure what Sofia was planning either. Was there some strange Ryzhaya magic she could pull? Or was she just providing a distraction? She slapped away a mosquito attempting to snack on her exposed left wrist, between her jacket and gloves. As oversized an SUV as her car was, she doubted it could tank two entire adult reindeer to the grill, as well as a human. But her other option, flight, didn't seem appealing either, unless Sofia could nab Alexey and get back in the car. She felt that she could probably maneuver around her adversaries in that case.

"You are going to have to explain yourself," said Nikolay Nikolaevitch. "Are you perhaps Anna Pankratyevna? You seem a little old, —"

<!-- His next word was going to be "but". -->

He started coughing, and bent over and held up a finger. His brother and cousin looked on in mild concern, but did not break form.

"No," said Sofia. "I'm not. I am _Sofia_ Pankratyevna. You were led to believe that Alexey is the heir to the Ryzhaya line, yes? He isn't. Did you really think the heir would be a _boy?_"

Nikolay Nikolaevitch, finished with his coughing fit, replied, "Sorry about that. A bug flew right into my windpipe. Anyways: Sofia Nikolaevna's will is of public record, and the city council seemed to be of the opinion that it clearly named Alexey as the beneficiary of the title to the Ryzhaya estate, however extraordinary it may seem. So–" He swatted away a mosquito buzzing around his face. "So, unless Alexey is already dead, and he isn't, he's right there and I can _see_ his breath, no, you're not the heir. Could you maybe ask ▓▒▓▓▓▓▒ Ilyitch to turn the lights down? I feel like I'm swimming in midges and mosquitos here." He swatted the air around his face some more.

"Her name, as I understand it, is Artemis Ilyinichna. How much, exactly, do you know about the Ryzhayas?" asked Sofia.

Artemis stared at Sofia. She was having trouble reconciling this commanding figure with the girl she'd made burst into tears just a minute ago. She also wished Sofia hadn't brought her identity into it. Why did cis people always seem to think that it was an argument they could win? Even as… herself, Artemis had trouble defending herself. She had no faith in Sofia's ability to do so, and whatever happened, Nikolay Nikolaevitch would say a lot of hurtful things that Artemis would rather not hear. The best thing she could hope for was that he would just ignore Sofia's clarification.

"I know… enough… not to _trust_ you, please, can we seriously turn the lights off? I swear, it's October, there shouldn't be this many mosquitos around at this time of the year. I'm trying to be nice, here, but if you won't do it for me, I'll do it for you. …no, I'm not going to wait, I'll just do it." He closed a hand into a fist, and the lights shut off, as did the car's engine. Artemis's eyes widened. Her only plan of escape had just been cut off.

Sofia continued the dialogue as if nothing had happened. "It wasn't the lights. And if you are surprised by the mosquitos, then you will be surprised by this, too: as a Ryzhaya, they are my _friends._ Maybe if you let them drink a little of your blood, they'd be your friends, too. Wouldn't that be nice? Come on. Share a little. Don't you want a gossipy network of friends all around the world? It doesn't cost much."

Nikolay Nikolaevitch straightened up. "Ah, I see." He paused either for effect or to sneak an unobstructed breath in. "I thought you trafficked in abominations, disease spirits, and mythical monsters, not… pests. If this is all you can do to intimidate me, then… color me… goddammit… unimpressed. Unimpressed, but _very_ annoyed."
