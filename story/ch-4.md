[**Previously**](ch-3.html)

Alexey wandered the abandoned, sunken hallways of Keleykh Lower School in the darkness. There was no moonlight, but the oil slicks he stepped in here and there seemed slightly phosphorescent, their rainbow webbing dimly visible despite the lack of any incident light. He had been trying to find his way out for more hours than he could count. In corners, in doorways, and submerged in especially deep puddles of oil were unidentifiable corpses, mummified as though dredged from western Siberia's numerous bogs. Alexey longed for a clean breath. Besides the stink of the oil, the air was full of lint and ash. Each breath choked him.

He knew for a fact that he was the only living creature left. He held, in his mind, the power to resurrect one, and only one, of the bodies. He thought of his friends. He thought of Sofia. He thought of Xenia. But none of them were in the Lower School. Alexey wanted nothing more than to find his way out, crawl onto the tar-laden streets, and seek them out. He was growing very, very cold, however, and had little life left in his steps.

Rounding a corner, he ascended a staircase. The wooden handrails were blackened with creosote tar, which had collected enough dust that Alexey, motivated in no small part by overwhelming fatigue, decided that the rails weren't too sticky to use. Looking back at where he'd come from, Alexey discovered what sort of dim light source had been illuminating the oil's sheen: a tungsten-filament lightbulb, buried under enough dust and lint that its very light seemed gray. Swiveling his head further revealed that the lightbulb was the source of the buzzing, grinding noise that made his heartbeat  violently pound on the insides of his skull.

Alexey stumbled over a missing stair, and fell into an ink-black void in the stairs that he'd failed to notice while distracted by the bulb. He fell through nothingness, hoping he'd finally found the way to the sky, and would finally start seeing stars. The atmosphere in the void was perfectly clean, but too thin, and no matter how deep the breaths he took were, he couldn't get enough air.

"Alexey?"

Oh, no.

"Thank you for resurrecting me, Alexey. You can't know how deeply I appreciate it."

The words filled his ears with cold, flowing, mildly sweet glass. Alexey opened his eyes, not having realized he'd been keeping them shut. He found himself kneeling in the grand atrium of Lykov House, the home of the Sump. He had been here so many times before, attending parties, dances, speeches, and ceremonies, worrying about whether he'd had more than his share of hors d'œvres. Today, neither sunlight nor moonlight came down through the panelled glass skylight dome, and its windows appeared to be piled deeper with snow (or perhaps ash) than he'd ever seen. Where Alexey knelt, there was a fanciful abstract design on the ground evoking perhaps the Sun, assembled from heavy blocks of variously colored dimension stone that stretched into the ground to a depth of a meter or more, cut to shape. He had one day idly determined that it was mainly granite and some marble, and awaited the day when the marble tiles would show visible dents from so many people's feet, while the granite tiles wouldn't. It had been his earliest private mental rebellion in the Sump, an odd wish to see it humbled in even so small a way, for reasons he couldn't place at the time. The Sump had certainly affected humility often enough already.

Standing at his podium that broke the marble backbone stairway of the house in two like a rock ledge jutting out of a waterfall, and lit solely by the two ponderous gaslights flanking said stairway that served as the atrium's hearth, was Pyotr Ivanovitch Lykov, graciously thanking Alexey for having the kindness to save his life. Pyotr was a man of many titles, including (an animal squirmed in Alexey at the thought of this) that of Alexey's aspiring surrogate father, but standing at the podium gave him one title above all others: the supreme leader of the Sump. The man with the drum of human skin, the man who will save the entire world singlehandedly. He was wearing a relaxed smile, and a rather unassuming buttoned white shirt and comfortable work pants. He extended an open hand, of uncertain purpose considering that Alexey was at least twenty meters across the room.

"Hey, it's gonna be okay. You made the right choice. Why don't you get up?"

Alexey did rise, distracted with the thought that he could be so evil as to choose this man over his friends. He walked in the direction of the stairs, potentially to meet Pyotr up close. But as he walked, he frowned, and came to a halt. The closer he got to Pyotr, the more the invasive buzzing receded. Standing nearly at the foot of the stairs, he had to listen for the noise to even notice it.

"Why did you…?" asked Alexey.

"That's not a question," observed Pyotr mildly.

The two men stared at each other. Alexey took a step back. The gaslights flickered.

Pyotr frowned. "What's wrong? It's just me. I don't bite," he joked.

Alexey thought about the people he'd wanted to bring back, and came to a realization.

"Her name was Xenia," he said, as much to himself as to Pyotr.

Confusion. "…who?"

"The girl you killed. Her name was Xenia, and she was my friend, and you killed her."

"You're not making sense, Alyosha. Who do you think I killed? You know me. You know what I stand for. I'm always trying my hardest to _save_ everyone, not kill them. You are too, I _know_ you are. You're an incredibly strong and smart person, Alyosha, and as two of the most rational people in Keleykh, we can talk this out. But please don't tell me I killed this 'Xenia'. I have never known a Xenia and never killed anyone."

The gaslit hearths went out entirely. The skylight dome's window panes creaked under the weight of whatever it was they were holding back. The buzzing returned to Alexey's ears, loud enough that a part of him reflexively started worrying about long-term hearing loss.

"You do _not. Call me that._ Only Artemis is allowed to call me that. You do not kill my friends and then call me 'Alyosha.'"

Pyotr started to get more of a clue of what was going on. The name "Artemis" rang a disappointing bell. "Ah, 'Artemis'… do you still keep in touch with him? He is sorely missed at the Sump," he probed cautiously.

"Artemis knew her, too. First, Xenia's friend, who died before she could even be named, killed herself, thanks to you and Katya. I really, really thought Xenia would pull through. She was so smart and sane, you know? Me and Artemis looked up to her. She was the one who pointed out the problems with the Sump to us in the first place. And she…" Alexey trailed off, confused. He wanted to say something about how Xenia was responsible for both him and Artemis discovering their true identities, but while it had made sense for Artemis as a trans person, he had trouble putting into words what Xenia had contributed to his own identity. "She was your strongest opponent. She took everything she learned from you and tried to use it to break your poisonous, treacherous, _extremely fake_ power. But… I don't know what happened. Or no, I do, and Artemis does too, because we all hate ourselves on a level you can't even comprehend, in the same exact way, and it's _your fucking fault._ And so Xenia—"

Pyotr snapped. "Oh, I'm _sorry,_ you have serious mental health issues and you decided to blame _me?_ I take back what I said about your rationality, Alexey, you have to be really… _special_ to think it makes any goddamn sense to make your _obvious mental illness_ MY responsibility. I didn't raise you, I didn't own you, and I certaily didn't abuse you in any way, so if you decide to use the word 'traumagenic' even _once—_"

Alexey lunged at Pyotr and grabbed him by the neck, toppling him off the podium and slamming his head on the marble steps. Pyotr, dazed, didn't immediately think to fight back—

"She became _insane,_ is what happened! If I talk to _any_ trans person who you haven't touched, they will have normal, sane self-doubts, like their face or their hair or their shadow!"

The skylight window panels caved in, and petroleum soot and ash, interspersed with ice crystals, poured into the room in a roaring blizzard colder and heavier than the most violent snowstorm, as though the weight of the whole world were being forced through the new perforations in Lykov House's dome. Alexey's voice rose to a scream, for ambiguous reasons.

"Then along comes Xenia's friend with some nonsense about how the _eastern half of her shadow soul_ is irrevocably male, or something, and kills herself, and Xenia _buys it_ and _swims out to sea herself!_ WHO DO YOU THINK SHE GOT HER METAPHYSICS FROM, PYOTR IVANOVICH? _DOES ANY OF THIS SOUND FAMILIAR?_ And Artemis and I are the same way! We have not only our _normal_ doubts, we _then_ have this _insane disease of our reasoning ability_ you have forced upon us! And you, you won't take your own advice and listen to a fucking—"

The blizzard buried them both, ending the nightmare.
