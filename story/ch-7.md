The only seating in the study was the chair behind the desk, but Alexey declined even that. He instead opted to sit irreverently on the grand desk itself, putting him almost half a meter above eye level with Sofia. She could have stolen past him and taken the chair for herself, but she was too intimidated to try.

"So. Sofia," said Alexey. He was choosing his words as carefully as he could, drawing upon a lifetime of diplomacy. "How much experience do you actually have withâ€¦ talking to people?"

This seemed a stupid question to Sofia. "I don't talk to _myself,_ Alexey, and I've spent every day of my life talking since my first word, so _yes,_ I _do_ have experience, thank you."

Alexey sighed. "Yeah. I figured that much. How much of that was with our... with Mom?"

Sofia was trying very hard to see where this was going, and failing. "Most of it, yes. Is that your point? That I don't know how to talk to people other than Mom?"

These next words of Alexey's had to be the most careful of all. "No. Not... quite. I... what did you talk about, with Mom? Because..."

"Stop asking questions, Alexey, and just get to the damn point! You're not Socrates! What do you _want_ from me?"

"I'm sorry, this is so difficult. It's just... a lot of what I talked about with Mom was, well, her. It was about her. Because she was..."

"Suicidal? Depressed?" Sofia wasn't accusing.

Alexey nodded. "For you too, then?"

Sophia drew out a long, slow sigh, as she very gently and slowly let her guard down. "Nearly every day. She would be stressed, from work, and from taking care of me, and from housework, and then... I don't know, it felt like there wasn't even a right answer." She gained momentum as she committed to the soliloquy. "Nothing I ever did was _good_ enough. She'd start yelling at me, about how I never helped her with housework or something, and... it's terrible, but I actually started _winning_ those arguments. Because, I don't know, maybe I got better at it or she got worse at it, but she'd start bringing up my motivations, or the quality of my work, or something, and she always asked the same _stupid_ questions like whether I want our family to die out or the house to rot or _whatever,_ and... eventually, I..." She trailed off, eyes full of tears, voice broken.

"Eventually you just had all the answers," Alexey finished for her. "Even if they weren't answers you liked. May I hug you?"

Sofia, face red, nodded and wiped her nose. She broke into sobs as Alexey embraced her.

"I'm sorry," said Alexey. "I'm sorry, I went through it, too. I won those arguments, too. And I know what you wanted to say next about the issue, because you're the one who mentioned she was suicidal, and that's what I've been trying to get at this whole time: she made you _regret_ winning, didn't she?"

Sofia choked on a sob. "It..." she whispered, as Alexey released her from the hug, "It was so, so much worse. Once she had nothing left to lose. I... I-I didn't want her to die, so I had to keep talking to her, or-or keep her talking, and it was like this new, horrible kind of argument where I couldn't win because it all came back to how nobody loved or appreciated her and how she was worthless... I don't know, Alexey. Did I kill her? She got so _sloppy_ in the last few months. Going out without her drum. Then without even an idol. That last day... yesterday... she went out with _nothing._ She still wanted to die. I never could convince her she was loved. I tried really, really hard to love her, but"
