The only seating in the study was the chair behind the desk, but Alexey declined even that. He instead opted to sit irreverently on the grand desk itself, putting him almost half a meter above eye level with Sofia. She could have stolen past him and taken the chair for herself, but she was too intimidated to try.

"So. Sofia," said Alexey. He was choosing his words as carefully as he could, drawing upon a lifetime of diplomacy. "How much experience do you actually have with… talking to people?"

This seemed a stupid question to Sofia. "I don't talk to _myself,_ Alexey, and I've spent every day of my life talking since my first word, so _yes,_ I _do_ have experience, thank you."

Alexey sighed. "Yeah. I figured that much. How much of that was with our… with Mom?"

Sofia was trying very hard to see where this was going, and failing. "Most of it, yes. Is that your point? That I don't know how to talk to people other than Mom?"

These next words of Alexey's had to be the most careful of all. "No. Not… quite. I… what did you talk about, with Mom? Because…"

"Stop asking questions, Alexey, and just get to the damn point! You're not Socrates! What do you _want_ from me?"

"I'm sorry, this is so difficult. It's just… a lot of what I talked about with Mom was, well, her. It was about her. Because she was…"

"Suicidal? Depressed?" Sofia wasn't trying to be accusing, but the words tasted very bitter in her mouth.

Alexey nodded. "For you too, then?"

Sophia drew out a long, slow sigh, as she very gently and slowly let her guard down. "Nearly every day. She would be stressed, from work, and from taking care of me, and from housework, and then… I don't know, it felt like there wasn't even a right answer." She gained momentum as she committed to the soliloquy. "Nothing I ever did was _good_ enough. She'd start yelling at me, about how I never helped her with housework or something, and… it's terrible, but I actually started _winning_ those arguments. Because, I don't know, maybe I got better at it or she got worse at it, but she'd start bringing up my motivations, or the quality of my work, or something, and she always asked the same _stupid_ questions like whether I want our family to die out or the house to rot or _whatever,_ and… eventually, I…" She trailed off, eyes full of tears, voice broken.

"Eventually you just had all the answers," Alexey finished for her. "Even if they weren't answers you liked. May I hug you?"

Sofia, face red, nodded and wiped her nose. She broke into sobs as Alexey slipped off the desk and embraced her.

"I'm sorry," said Alexey. "I'm sorry, I went through it, too. I won those arguments, too. And I know what you wanted to say next, because you're the one who mentioned she was suicidal, and that's what I've been trying to get at this whole time: she made you _regret_ winning, didn't she?"

Sofia choked on a sob. "It…" she whispered, as Alexey released her from the hug, "It was so, so much worse. Once she had nothing left to lose. I… I-I didn't want her to die, so I had to keep talking to her, or-or keep her talking, and it was like this new, horrible kind of argument where I couldn't win because it all came back to how nobody loved or appreciated her and how she was worthless… I don't know, Alexey. Did I kill her? She got so _sloppy_ in the last few months. Going out without her drum. Then without even an idol. That last day… yesterday… she went out with _nothing._ She still wanted to die. I never could convince her she was loved. I tried really, really hard to love her, but—"

"Sofia, that's not your responsibility!" exclaimed Alexey, so suddenly and loudly that Sofia reflexively jumped back. Alexey felt guilty for this, as he'd been trying his best to control his tone and volume, but he couldn't help it. "I mean, God, did nobody tell you? Someone told you, right? When… okay, sorry, I'll stop asking questions and just tell you what happened to me: the first time my mother tried to kill herself was when I was eight years old. Do you think an eight-year-old can… I dunno, Sofia, did you _ask_ for this responsibility? Did you ever have a _choice?_ Never mind that an eight-year-old should never, ever have to deal with _anything_ like that. I said I'd stop asking questions, so let me answer for you: she never gave you a choice, and she never should have dumped her problems on a little girl. _Obviously._ I'm, I'm genuinely asking now, though, sorry, but, you _know_ none of this is your fault, right? Please tell me you had, I dunno, some friend, or some… I dunno, literally anyone else, someone sane, who could tell you it's not… Sofia?"

<div>By way of answering, Sofia only cried.</div>

"Garlic, ginger. Sichuan pepper," said Tosha, addressing the ingredients on the cutting board and in a small bowl in front of him. "Smashed and peeled the garlic. Peeled the ginger. Don't have to do anything to the pepper. Now I dice." Having already sharpened the knife, Tosha started cutting the garlic and ginger.

Artemis and Vasilisa were hanging out just behind them, for lack of anything better to do. Artemis wanted to see if she'd bought the right ingredients, and Vasilisa just didn't want to be alone right now, not to mention that she was cut off from the study, which was the best source of books in the house. Tosha had decided to treat this development as an excuse to teach them his mapo tofu recipe.

"That's the aromatics done," said Tosha, once they finished the dice. "Normally there'd be red peppers too but you guys don't like it if it's too spicy." He paused, trying to figure out how to present the next part of the recipe. "Uh. Guess I should toast the peppercorns. Um. How do you work this thing…?" The kitchen had a five-burner stovetop, but it was unclear how it was lit, as the knobs didn't seem to do anything. Tosha looked in the cabinet underneath, and discovered a propane tank. "Oh." The turn of a knob later, the gas was flowing.

"Uh. Artemis, could you get me the matches, please?" asked Tosha.

"Yeah, hold—"

"Never mind," said Tosha, discovering four new matchbooks in a nearby drawer. "That's convenient."

His companions waited patiently as he obtained a large cast-iron wok from a high shelf, the standard cookware for a Keleykhsky kitchen. They turned up the heat and lit the stove, setting the match aside.

"Toast the peppercorns first. Until they leave little streaks of oil on the pan. Then… Artemis, what oils did you buy?"

"Peanut oil, sesame oil, chili oil. And that Grandma stuff."

"Lǎogānmā. Old Godmother."

"That."

"Good. Now, I'll add the peanut oil and the garlic and ginger, and fry it on a low flame. Also the Lǎogānmā. Uh, low flame, because these burn easily. Let me… just…" Having already added the aforementioned ingredients to the wok, Tosha frantically rooted around the groceries to find a bottle of rice wine. Hands shaking, they uncorked it and poured some into the bubbling oil. "Sorry, usually that bottle's just there. Need it for deglazing. So stuff doesn't stick. Then… did you buy dòubànjiàng?"

"What?" asked Artemis.

"The fermented fava beans."

"Oh. Yeah."

"That comes next… oh, here it is. Good, it's the spicy kind."

"Should I start making rice?" asked Vasilisa. Tosha had a strange habit of forgetting the rice.

<div>"Oh, yeah, sorry," said Tosha. "Please do. Should have started already."</div>

"…and my first suicide attempt was when I was _nine,_" said Sofia. "Just a year later. So, yes, of course there was a connection."

"_Nine?_" asked Alexey incredulously. "God*damn.* I don't remember _anything_ from when I was nine. How'd you do it?"

"Um," said Sofia, not really liking this direction of inquiry.

"Sorry, insensitive question," said Alexey. "I just… I dunno if I even knew _how_ when I was nine."

"Well, Mom was always warning me about sleeping with too many furs," said Sofia wistfully. This did spark a dim memory in Alexey's mind, but he kept quiet. "She said I'd pile too many on my face and suffocate. So… that's what I tried."

"Well… did it work?"

"…did I die?"

"Sure," said Alexey. He was trying to titrate some levity back into the discussion, and hoped Sofia would pick up on it.

"Yes, Alexey," replied Sofia, cracking a weak smile to show that she understood. "I died, and went to the Kingdom of the Dead. I just left, because it was boring there, and Mom still needed a therapist."

"So you _do_ know what a therapist is," joked Alexey.

"I do. I've only had to be one for the past… eighteen years, at least."

"Then, I guess, that's my point. If you're such a good therapist, why did you yell at Vasilisa like that?"

"Because…" Sofia was instantly frustrated again, as if the argument about the broken idol had never ended. "She broke my idol! What in the blazes was I supposed to say? 'Oh, it's okay, dear, you survived and I have plenty more idols?'"

"You weren't supposed to _diagnose_ her with _narcissism._"

Sofia exploded. "Oh, like you never heard that from Mom! Like it wasn't… like it wasn't on the table! Big important Ryzhaya heiress, with a house full of disease spirits, what else would she use to insult you if she didn't like something you did? If she… if she spotted even an _inkling_ of similarity to an idol she had? Good grief, Alexey, I don't… kn-know how else to say it. I don't know what else I could have said."

Alexey sighed, massaging his face slowly, trying to decide how best to unpack what he just heard. Eventually, he spoke: "Sofia… I dunno if this is news to you, but, our mother isn't exactly an example to be followed."

Sofia crossed her arms and glared. "You think I don't know that?"

"So then—"

<div>"<i>But,</i>" insisted Sofia, "Who else do you expect me to become?"</div>

"Now we can add it to the wok," said Tosha, gesturing at a mound of tofu he'd just cut into large cubes while the aromatics and dòubànjiàng fried. "You're supposed to blanch the tofu first, to firm it up and get rid of the aftertaste, but, at the matchbox house we only had one stove, and I kind of like the aftertaste anyway, so I don't do that part."

They carefully loaded the tofu on the blade of the knife and slid it into the wok, in batches. "Gypsum tofu like this will break easily if you push it around too hard. So, I have to be really gentle here."

Artemis and Vasilisa's attention was now waning desperately, but they knew this was almost the end. This wasn't the first time they'd seen Tosha make mapo tofu, although it may have been the first time they paid more than passing attention.

"And now…" Tosha filled a pot most of the way with cold water. "We turn it into soup." He dumped the water into the wok.

Vasilisa let out a sigh of relief. "So, that's it then, right? Now you just let the soup simmer?"

"Almost," said Tosha. "I've still gotta add some spices and stuff. And the leeks. But yeah." They obtained salt, white pepper, soy sauce, Hungarian hot paste, and some leeks from the grocery bags, nearly depleting them entirely. They sprinkled the spices in, and began washing the leeks and cutting them into rings.

Artemis sat down at the kitchen table, relieved to be able to focus on something else. "Hey, so, Vasilisa, what are you gonna read next, after that Ryzhaya book? _Metaphors_ or whatever?"

"_Metamorphoses,_" corrected Vasilisa, "And, there was this bookshelf full of what looked like school textbooks that I wanted to go through. I mean, _first_ I'm gonna read that textbook on transformations, because that's the coolest thing ever and I wanna be a fox like _right_ now forever. But like, after I read through that, there's those other textbooks that I bet are pretty interesting. Also, there was this thing on the desk…" She frowned. "There was this packet of papers on the desk that looked really interesting. I think… I think it might be the last thing Alexey's mom read before she died. It was called _The Division… The Division of something and the Sun,_ or something, and the weird part is the author was called 'Yaminya.'"

This did not ring a bell for Artemis, and she let Vasilisa know with a polite stare of incomprehension.

"Yaminya is the hero of the Nenets epics," supplied Vasilisa. "She was some great shaman or something. I dunno if she's, like, the actual author of the packet or just someone's pen name or what, but if anyone has something written by the historical Yaminya, it's _gotta_ be the Ryzhayas."

Tosha chose this moment to join Artemis at the table. "Everything is done," they said. "Just gotta wait until it reduces. Maybe add starch."

"And until the rice is done," reminded Vasilisa.

<div>"And until the rice is done," agreed Tosha.</div>

"It should _never_ be your first resort." Alexey was presently formulating a lecture on the subject of hurtful speech, and struggling to phrase it in a way that Sofia might understand. "It was for Mom. But she was wrong, understand? She didn't achieve _anything_ good by belittling you and making up fake diseases. She just hurt you, and she hurt me, and now she's dead and we both have awful memories of her. That isn't... she didn't achieve her goals."

Sofia, who thought of herself as a fairly nice person, was still a little miffed that Alexey was trying to convince her that she wasn't being nice enough. "'Not a first resort?'" she quoted sourly.

"Nor your second, nor your third, nor really any resort when it comes to your friends," agreed Alexey. "I mean, come on, this is Vasilisa we're talking about. You don't know her very well, yet, but she's, like, the sweetest girl you'll ever meet. She's got nothing but love and enthusiasm, and it's really, really easy to break her heart if she trusts you. And like, forget that it's cruel and heartless, it's unproductive! If you abuse her---"

"Excuse me, _abuse?_ I didn't _abuse_ her, Alexey."

"Verbally and emotionally abuse, yes, you did," countered Alexey. "You hurt her in a way where you intentionally made it hard for her to deal with it. How easy is it to refute a diagnosis by a Ryzhaya? You _abused_ your authority to hurt her."

Sofia had nothing to say to that.

"Don't you want Vasilisa to be happy? Even if you just want her to work, people work a lot better when they're happy."

"How exactly," said Sofia through gritted teeth, "Am I supposed to keep her 'happy' when she makes a mistake that both weakens us and nearly kills both her and Artemis?"

"By reassuring her that you aren't mad at her! And that you're glad she made it out okay!" Alexey wasn't angry or trying to yell; if anything, he was enthusiastic that Sofia was finally asking the right questions. "You can be firm when you warn her to never make that mistake again, sure. That's a normal thing to do. Just don't try to make her feel bad about it. You can help her not make the mistake again by, I dunno, explaining to her why it was a mistake, or reminding her next time she might make it, or, I dunno, any number of things! But for God's sake, Sofia, don't _hurt_ her over it. She's hurt enough as it is. Save that for... Pyotr Lykov, or something. For your enemies."

"What if," said Sofia slowly, "_I_ feel bad about it? And I want her to understand how badly she hurt _me?_"

"Well, then," said Alexey, somewhat nonplussed, "_Tell_ her that. Directly. 'You hurt me and I expect an apology.' Or something. There are many words in the Russian language to express such a thing."

"...and if I _want_ to just hurt her instead? As payback?"

"Then," said Alexey menacingly, "Suck it the _hell_ up. Or lose a friend."

The mirror twins were silent for a while.
