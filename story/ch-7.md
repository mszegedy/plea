The only seating in the study was the chair behind the desk, but Alexey declined even that. He instead opted to sit irreverently on the grand desk itself, putting him almost half a meter above eye level with Sofia. She could have stolen past him and taken the chair for herself, but she was too intimidated to try.

"So. Sofia," said Alexey. He was choosing his words as carefully as he could, drawing upon a lifetime of diplomacy. "How much experience do you actually have with… talking to people?"

This seemed a stupid question to Sofia. "I don't talk to _myself,_ Alexey, and I've spent every day of my life talking since my first word, so _yes,_ I _do_ have experience, thank you."

Alexey sighed. "Yeah. I figured that much. How much of that was with our… with Mom?"

Sofia was trying very hard to see where this was going, and failing. "Most of it, yes. Is that your point? That I don't know how to talk to people other than Mom?"

These next words of Alexey's had to be the most careful of all. "No. Not… quite. I… what did you talk about, with Mom? Because…"

"Stop asking questions, Alexey, and just get to the damn point! You're not Socrates! What do you _want_ from me?"

"I'm sorry, this is so difficult. It's just… a lot of what I talked about with Mom was, well, her. It was about her. Because she was…"

"Suicidal? Depressed?" Sofia wasn't trying to be accusing, but the words tasted very bitter in her mouth.

Alexey nodded. "For you too, then?"

Sophia drew out a long, slow sigh, as she very gently and slowly let her guard down. "Nearly every day. She would be stressed, from work, and from taking care of me, and from housework, and then… I don't know, it felt like there wasn't even a right answer." She gained momentum as she committed to the soliloquy. "Nothing I ever did was _good_ enough. She'd start yelling at me, about how I never helped her with housework or something, and… it's terrible, but I actually started _winning_ those arguments. Because, I don't know, maybe I got better at it or she got worse at it, but she'd start bringing up my motivations, or the quality of my work, or something, and she always asked the same _stupid_ questions like whether I want our family to die out or the house to rot or _whatever,_ and… eventually, I…" She trailed off, eyes full of tears, voice broken.

"Eventually you just had all the answers," Alexey finished for her. "Even if they weren't answers you liked. May I hug you?"

Sofia, face red, nodded and wiped her nose. She broke into sobs as Alexey slipped off the desk and embraced her.

"I'm sorry," said Alexey. "I'm sorry, I went through it, too. I won those arguments, too. And I know what you wanted to say next, because you're the one who mentioned she was suicidal, and that's what I've been trying to get at this whole time: she made you _regret_ winning, didn't she?"

Sofia choked on a sob. "It…" she whispered, as Alexey released her from the hug, "It was so, so much worse. Once she had nothing left to lose. I… I-I didn't want her to die, so I had to keep talking to her, or-or keep her talking, and it was like this new, horrible kind of argument where I couldn't win because it all came back to how nobody loved or appreciated her and how she was worthless… I don't know, Alexey. Did I kill her? She got so _sloppy_ in the last few months. Going out without her drum. Then without even an idol. That last day… yesterday… she went out with _nothing._ She still wanted to die. I never could convince her she was loved. I tried really, really hard to love her, but—"

"Sofia, that's not your responsibility!" exclaimed Alexey, so suddenly and loudly that Sofia reflexively jumped back. Alexey felt guilty for this, as he'd been trying his best to control his tone and volume, but he couldn't help it. "I mean, God, did nobody tell you? Someone told you, right? When… okay, sorry, I'll stop asking questions and just tell you what happened to me: the first time my mother tried to kill herself was when I was eight years old. Do you think an eight-year-old can… I dunno, Sofia, did you _ask_ for this responsibility? Did you ever have a _choice?_ Never mind that an eight-year-old should never, ever have to deal with _anything_ like that. I said I'd stop asking questions, so let me answer for you: she never gave you a choice, and she never should have dumped her problems on a little girl. _Obviously._ I'm, I'm genuinely asking now, though, sorry, but, you _know_ none of this is your fault, right? Please tell me you had, I dunno, some friend, or some… I dunno, literally anyone else, someone sane, who could tell you it's not… Sofia?"

<div>By way of answering, Sofia only cried.</div>

"Garlic, ginger. Sichuan pepper," said Tosha, addressing the ingredients on the cutting board and in a small bowl in front of him. "Smashed and peeled the garlic. Peeled the ginger. Don't have to do anything to the pepper. Now I dice." Having already sharpened the knife, Tosha started cutting the garlic and ginger.

Artemis and Vasilisa were hanging out just behind them, for lack of anything better to do. Artemis wanted to see if she'd bought the right ingredients, and Vasilisa just didn't want to be alone right now, not to mention that she was cut off from the study, which was the best source of books in the house. Tosha had decided to treat this development as an excuse to teach them his mapo tofu recipe.

"That's the aromatics done," said Tosha, once they finished the dice. "Normally there'd be red peppers too but you guys don't like it if it's too spicy." He paused, trying to figure out how to present the next part of the recipe. "Uh. Guess I should toast the peppercorns. Um. How do you work this thing…?" The kitchen had a five-burner stovetop, but it was unclear how it was lit, as the knobs didn't seem to do anything. Tosha looked in the cabinet underneath, and discovered a propane tank. "Oh." The turn of a knob later, the gas was flowing.

"Uh. Artemis, could you get me the matches, please?" asked Tosha.

"Yeah, hold—"

"Never mind," said Tosha, discovering four new matchbooks in a nearby drawer. "That's convenient."

His companions waited patiently as he obtained a large cast-iron wok from a high shelf, the standard cookware for a Keleykhsky kitchen. They turned up the heat and lit the stove, setting the match aside.

"Toast the peppercorns first. Until they leave little streaks of oil on the pan. Then… Artemis, what oils did you buy?"

"Peanut oil, sesame oil, chili oil. And that Grandma stuff."

"Lǎogānmā. Old godmother."

"That."

"Good. Now, I'll add the peanut oil and the garlic and ginger, and fry it for a bit on a low flame. Also the lǎogānmā. Then… did you buy dòubànjiàng?"

"What?"

"The fermented fava beans."

"Oh. Yeah."

"That comes next… oh, here it is."

"Should I put on rice?" asked Vasilisa. Tosha had a strange habit of forgetting the rice.

<div>"Oh, yeah, sorry," said Tosha. "Please do."</div>
