Artemis nervously shuffled her way down the street, pushing her way through thick crowds. Before leaving, she had compiled a list of grocery items and meds to obtain with the help of Tosha and Vasilisa. It was her personal belief that they were letting Alexey sleep in too long, but in his case, she knew his meds already by heart. Sofia had no contributions to make to either list, although Artemis was planning on purchasing a doubled amount of Alexey's meds, just in case he ended up having to share them with Sofia. She would figure out the chirality issue later, although luckily Alexey's lithium didn't need reversing.

Her left hand was buried in her coat pocket, clutching a metal figurine of a woman like one might clutch a concealed pistol. This was an apt analogy, for its only use was to escalate fights and to intimidate her enemies, not as a first resort for self defense. Artemis was interested in stealth, anyhow, not fighting. It just didn't hurt to have a backup plan. A thin loop of string around her neck was tied to another figurine inside her coat, this one of stone and shaped like a hedgehog. This idol was the true powerhouse behind the operation, and made Artemis's current concealment possible.

Before Artemis had left, she had anointed both idols with her blood. "It's not necessary," Sofia had said, "But it can't hurt." Her hypothesis was that a small meal of her blood would endear the idols to her for a short time. This was not a normal way to feed an idol, but the Ryzhayas were a different breed.

Artemis stopped at an intersection and looked at the signage, frustrated. She couldn't remember where the hell this intersection was located on the main street relative to the store, and resented it. She felt small, afraid, and like a failure. "A little fear is good," Sofia had told her. "That's the idol working. You have to let it work. Embrace its effect. Otherwise you can't use it."

<div>She picked a direction and kept pushing.</div>

An hour ago, Sofia was explaining the basics of disease spirit idols to Artemis and Vasilisa.

"The way it works is, once you bottle the disease, you can release it at will. That part's obvious," she said in a lecturing tone, which had Alexey been awake, would have reminded him uncomfortably of his mother. "But what does releasing the disease mean? You don't just give people its symptoms. You recreate the _conditions_ under which the disease took place. A CO poisoning spirit won't just poison people, it'll create actual carbon monoxide. A flu spirit will smell like the breath of a sick person. A spirit of a broken bone can be used to apply great forces and break new things."

"So… we want a disease… where when people get it, other people lose track of them," said Vasilisa.

"Exactly," beamed Sofia. "You want to guess what that might be?"

"Um," began Artemis hesitantly, "Like… a bad sense of direction?"

"That might work, but probably not any better than evading them on your own would," said Sofia. "Not that we have a 'bad sense of direction' spirit to begin with. But you're on the right track. What disease makes you hidden?"

"Getting HIV or leprosy means nobody wants to talk to you," said Vasilisa ruefully.

"But it also calls attention to you. Come on, you've almost got it," insisted Sofia. "What disease makes you violently _reject_ attention?"

"Social anxiety?" asked Artemis. "No, wait, better than that, agoraphobia?"

Sofia clapped her hands, startling Alexey awake. "Exactly! Red star! I've got just the idol," she said, getting up and beckoning to the girls to follow. "It's this whole syndrome of social anxiety and a fear of crowds. The poor guy we got it from was a hermit. We only got it, what, three years ago? Anyway, it's in the study, where all the newer idols are. I'll take you."

Alexey, still half-asleep, became curious. "You guys are doing idols?" he mumbled sleepily.

"Uh, yeah," replied Artemis.

"Why?"

"I'm making a food and meds run."

"Oh. Good luck." He turned over. "Don't hurt 'em too bad. They're just dumb kids." He drifted back off to sleep.

Artemis felt that this wasn't giving her ethics and kind nature enough credit, but was somewhat relieved by Alexey's singular vote of confidence in her martial abilities, and by the time she'd thought of something to say in return, Alexey was back asleep.

"You coming?" asked Vasilisa.

<div>"Uh… yeah. Coming."</div>

Artemis did not know what the crowds looked like to an onlooker. Supposedly she was hidden in them without there being any visible sign she was using an idol. Was she just easy to glance over? Or actually invisible?

She bumped into a featureless man in business clothes. "Hey, watch it, asshole," he said, his voice sounding uncannily dead, almost sarcastic. Artemis paled. She did not want to be here. "I'm so sorry," she said, panicked. "I'll just leave, sorry." But he was already gone.

As one who's normally not had much trouble with social interactions, this was a new experience for Artemis. Had she not been under the influence of the idol, she would have just given him a middle finger and moved on. Maybe dismissed him with a clever insult. The disease, however, turned all attention on her into a burning, carcinogenic spotlight, and it was all she could do to not double over and vomit from radiation poisoning if it went on for more than a few seconds. She had steeled herself for the whole experience in advance, and bore the burden with some pride, as she remained firm in her decision to leave rather than sending Vasilisa in her stead. But privately, inwardly, she could complain as much as she wanted. And she was not having a good time.
