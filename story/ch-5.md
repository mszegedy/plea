[**Previously**](ch-4.html)

Artemis nervously shuffled her way down Republic Street, a prominent, commercial avenue, pushing her way through thick crowds. Before leaving, she had compiled a list of grocery items and medications to obtain with the help of Tosha and Vasilisa. It was her personal belief that they were letting Alexey sleep in too long, but in his case, she knew his meds already by heart. Sofia had no contributions to make to either list, although Artemis was planning on purchasing a doubled amount of Alexey's meds, just in case he ended up having to share them with Sofia. She would figure out the chirality issue later, although luckily Alexey's lithium didn't need reversing. She planned to buy caraway seeds to test whether chirality was even a concern, but was preparing for disappointment.

Her left hand was buried in her coat pocket, clutching a metal figurine of a woman like one might clutch a concealed pistol. This was an apt analogy, for its only use was to escalate fights and to intimidate her enemies, not as a first resort for self defense. Artemis was interested in stealth, anyhow, not fighting. It just didn't hurt to have a backup plan. A thin loop of string around her neck was tied to another figurine inside her coat, this one of stone and shaped like a hedgehog. This idol was the true powerhouse behind the operation, and made Artemis's current concealment possible.

Before Artemis had left, she had anointed both idols with her blood. "It's not necessary," Sofia had said, "But it can't hurt." Her hypothesis was that a small meal of Artemis's blood would endear the idols to her for a short time. This was not a normal way to feed an idol, but the Ryzhayas were a different breed.

Artemis stopped at an intersection and looked at the signage, frustrated. She couldn't remember where this intersection was located on Republic Street relative to the store, and resented it. She felt small, afraid, and like a failure. "A little fear is good," Sofia had told her. "That's the idol working. You have to let it work. Embrace its effect. Otherwise you can't use it."

<div>She picked a direction and kept pushing.</div>

An hour ago, Sofia was explaining the basics of disease spirit idols to Artemis and Vasilisa.

"The way it works is, once you bottle the disease, you can release it at will. That part's obvious," she said in a lecturing tone, which had Alexey been awake, would have reminded him uncomfortably of his mother. "But what does releasing the disease mean? You don't just give people its symptoms. You recreate the _conditions_ under which the disease took place. A CO poisoning spirit won't just poison people, it'll create actual carbon monoxide. A flu spirit will smell like the breath of a sick person. A spirit of a broken bone can be used to apply great forces and break things."

"So… we want a disease… where… people tend to feel its effects when other people lose track of them," said Vasilisa.

"Exactly," beamed Sofia. "You want to guess what that might be?"

"Um," began Artemis hesitantly, "Like… a bad sense of direction?"

"That might work, but probably not any better than evading them on your own would," said Sofia. "Not that we have a 'bad sense of direction' spirit to begin with. But you're on the right track. What disease makes you hidden?"

"Getting HIV or leprosy means nobody wants to talk to you," said Vasilisa ruefully.

"But it also calls attention to you. Come on, you've almost got it," insisted Sofia. "What disease makes you violently _reject_ attention?"

"Social anxiety?" asked Artemis. "No, wait, better than that, agoraphobia?"

Sofia clapped her hands, startling Alexey awake. "Exactly! Red star! I've got just the idol," she said, getting up and beckoning to the girls to follow. "It's this whole syndrome of social anxiety and a fear of crowds. The poor guy we got it from was a hermit. We only got it, what, three years ago? Anyway, it's in the study, where all the newer idols are. I'll take you."

Alexey, still half-asleep, became curious. "You guys are doing idols?" he mumbled sleepily.

"Uh, yeah," replied Artemis.

"Why?"

"I'm making a food and meds run."

"Oh. Good luck." He turned over. "Don't hurt 'em too bad. They're just dumb kids." He drifted back off to sleep.

Artemis felt that this wasn't giving her ethics and kind nature enough credit, but was somewhat relieved by Alexey's singular vote of confidence in her martial abilities, and by the time she'd thought of something to say in return, Alexey was back asleep.

"You coming?" asked Vasilisa.

<div>"Uh… yeah. Coming."</div>

Artemis did not know what the crowds looked like to an onlooker. Supposedly she was hidden in them without there being any visible sign she was using an idol. Was she just easy to glance over? Or actually invisible?

She bumped into a featureless man in business clothes. "Hey, watch it, asshole," he said, his voice sounding uncannily dead, almost sarcastic. Artemis paled. She did not want to be here. "I'm so sorry," she said, panicked. "I didn't mean to, sorry." But he was already gone.

As one who's normally not had much trouble with social interactions, this was a new experience for Artemis. Had she not been under the influence of the idol, she would have just given him a middle finger and moved on. Maybe dismissed him with a clever insult. The disease, however, turned all attention on her into a burning, carcinogenic spotlight, and it was all she could do to not double over and vomit from radiation poisoning if it went on for more than a few seconds. She had steeled herself for the whole experience in advance, and bore the burden with some pride, as she remained firm in her decision to leave rather than sending Vasilisa in her stead. But privately, inwardly, she could complain as much as she wanted. And she was not having a good time.

Her first stop was a small mom-and-pop pharmacy off of Republic Street. Pharmacies in Russia didn't typically ask for prescriptions, even for medications that were mandated by law as prescription-only, but Artemis was already very worried about the possibility. She had no plan for what to do in the case that they did ask, other than to conduct an armed robbery by means of the metal idol she was still clutching. It was true that it had never happened before in her entire past lifetime, but maybe the anxiety hedgehog (the phrase she had taken to thinking of the hedgehog idol by) would make the pharmacist unnaturally hostile to her like it did the phantoms in the crowd.

Artemis entered the pharmacy. She had a hard time telling, but its thirty or so square meters of bare wooden floor seemed deserted of customers besides the phantom crowd, as usual. The original, idly judgemental Artemis not completely suppressed by the idol, she wondered how the pharmacy stayed in business.

The phantoms seemed to be trying to stand in line at the counter, completely unheeded by the cashier. Artemis decided that she shouldn't feel remorseful pushing them out of the way so that she might take her turn.

"Um, hi, uh, excuse me?" she asked the pharmacist, muscling aside two phantoms. "Fuck off, wait your turn!" the one closer to the front of the line admonished, with the same deadened tone as the others had used.

The pharmacist looked up. "…good day? What can I do for you, sir?"

The last word drove a stake through Artemis's heart. What more could she possibly do to appear female? She was unwilling to compromise her pageboy haircut or her leather jacket and pants, but her voice and body contours should have been enough for anyone. It sometimes felt as though her remaining masculinity was located in the spirit world, and nothing short of an exorcism would stop people from detecting it. Idol or no idol, this was one of Artemis's worst vulnerabilities, and the reopening of the wound destroyed her already fragile concentration. She tried to piece it back together.

"Uh, um, hold on, let me get my list… I mean I'm picking up for family, so it's a lot…"

She frantically rooted around in the inside pockets of her coat and found a page.

"Oh… this is my grocery list… sorry, hold on, just one more moment." In retrospect, it seemed stupid to have two separate pages, but that was how the lists had gotten made. Artemis knew they must be in the same pocket…

"Hurry up, asshole! First you _cut_ the line, then you _hold up the line?_ I hope you get cancer and die, you piece of shit," yelled one of the phantoms from the back of the line. Artemis tried desperately to remind herself that it wasn't real, but failed to completely shrug off the insult. Her already frantic search became manic.

"I… I-I can't f-find it, I'm so sorry, I knew it was here somewhere…" Then she noticed the grocery list she was holding was actually made of two pages. "Wait! I've got it! Uh, I need lithium citrate, sertraline, bupropion, escitalopram, mirtazapine, lamotrigine, injectable estradiol valerate, injectable testosterone, bicalutamide, needles… uh, do you have all those? I can give the dosages and gauges."

The cashier stared at her.

<div>"Sir… this is the bakery. The pharmacy is next door."</div>

Meanwhile, Vasilisa was poking around in the Shchavel House study, eyeing works such as a small sheaf of papers stapled together titled "Unicorn, Mammoth, Whale: mythological and etymological connections of zoonyms in North and East Asia" in English, by one Juha Janhunen, or a leather-bound volume of yellowed pages with a glossy inset, titled _The Dubrovka collection: Northern spirits writ in birchbark_, by Yuvan Shestalov.

"So… if I wanted to learn magic, where would I start?" she asked Sofia.

"You should probably start with _Metamorphoses_," said Sofia, fetching a pile of typewritten papers, bound with bulldog clips, from the bookshelf that bore works written by the Ryzhayas themselves. The letters were faded, and it was rich with proof-reading marks and hand-drawn glyphs in much more vibrant blue ink.

"Like… the Latin thing?"

"No, it was written by a Ryzhaya. The first Ryzhaya, actually. It's, like, the Ryzhaya instruction manual. It's about binding disease spirits, and taming abominations, told in the form of an autobiographical song. Not that anyone remembers the melody."

"…the Latin thing was written by a _Ryzhaya?_"

"This isn't the same text! They just have the same name! I mean, I think the Latin one is somewhere around here, too. Hopefully on the classical Western literature shelf. If you care."

"Not really."

"Good. Anyway, so, Ryzhaya's words (or I think she was called Marsymyaku) were originally sung in really archaic Nganasan, but this version has translations and annotations in Old Komi by her great-granddaughter H"andula"amyaku, so you should get out the translators for both… shoot, I never explained this, but we have spirits we trained to translate stuff, I'll show you. I think it was H"andula"amyaku's idea to call it _Metamorphoses_, by the way. I'm not sure she knew that that was already a thing."

"Okay. Um. Why is it called _Metamorphoses_ if there's nothing about shapeshifting in it?"

"It's about turning diseases into advantages. How is that not a metamorphosis?"

"Okay… I guess."

Sofia detected more than a little disappointment in Vasilisa. "Look, if you want to read about shapeshifting, we have whole shelves of books on that. The one my mom made me read was…" She strode across the room to the section of recently published grimoires. She selected a relatively thin hardcover textbook, bound in purple gloss and poor typography, the cardboard on its corners visibly frayed. "This. _The mind that seeks to replace itself_, by Maria Szegedy. I think it was published only about four years ago."

"That's kind of a dramatic title for a textbook."

Sofia shrugged, trying not to dwell on uncomfortable memories. "Yeah, the author was a bit… weird. Like a fifth of the book is just her going on about how shapeshifting reveals something deep about our souls, or whatever. You can just skip those parts, they're not important."

Vasilisa snorted. "If _I_ wrote that book, fully _half_ of it would be metaphysical wanking. I'm reading all of it."

"Well, it's your choice. Don't say I didn't warn you. But yeah, before you get into it, you should read _Metamorphoses_ first. It's a lot shorter, and covers a lot more basic stuff."

Vasilisa nodded. "Work before play." She looked at the shapeshifting textbook and frowned. "This is in English."

"We have a translator for that, too. Though I've never needed it. My mom taught me English."

"Nice. …wait, does that mean Alexey knows English, too? I should ask him about it."

Sofia saw an opening to ask a few questions about her alternate self. She had been too polite to express it thus far, but she was intensely curious about Alexey. How would she have turned out, had she been born a boy? It was something she had already thought about long ago, years before she'd learned of Alexey's existence. She supposed that spending a childhood groomed to be the heiress to a powerful and restrictive family legacy naturally made one wonder about the alternatives.
