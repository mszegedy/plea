> A shaman needs a drum, so that the gods can hear them. And a daughter of mine needs a knife too, to feed the spirits with blood. The knife can also contain a spirit.

â€” _Metamorphoses_ by Marsymyaku (tr. H"andula"amyaku)

"Sofia, do you have any spare knives? Preferably ones that are also idols," said Vasilisa.

"Well..." began Sofia.

"You're going after Artemis?" asked Alexey, accusingly.

"Wait, what?" asked Sofia.

"Yes. I'm going after Artemis. Got a problem with that?" levelled Vasilisa.

"Nope. It's a good idea. I'll get you a knife from my mother's war chest," said Alexey.

"Wait, no, what? No! You have no idea what you're doing!" protested Sofia.

Vasilisa, already halfway to the stairs with Alexey, swivelled to face her. "We already _had_ this conversation, Sofia, and it ended with Artemis leaving," Vasilisa said pointedly. "Are you going to make it zero-for-two?"

"But..." Sofia couldn't choose a complaint. "...what do you even plan to _do?_"

"Shamanize," replied Vasilisa simply, in a tone that carried an implicit, "Duh."

<div>She and Alexey disappeared up the staircase.</div>

"You're not going to try to come with me, are you?" asked Vasilisa of Alexey, once they were in the master bedroom.

"Uh. Shouldn't I?" asked Alexey, opening a large leather-bound chest at the foot of the bed.

"No. No, you shouldn't, Alexey, come on. You don't move your king into the middle of the board as an opening."

"I'm not your king," grumbled Alexey, who hated being reminded of the existence of chess, as he had only bad memories of it. "I'm as expendable as anyone else."

"Oh, really? Then, like, ignoring that you're the one keeping our whole friend group from going insane, what'd happen when you died, huh? Do you have a will? Who's your next of kin?"

"I. Uh. Guess this place'd go to my sister."

"Do you want that?"

Alexey wanted his sister to never have to come back to this toxic city.

"Hell no," he said. "Alright, point made. I won't have any adventures until I file a will."

"Good. I'll come up with some other excuse by then. Now, a knife?"

"Oh yeah. What material?"

"Metal."

Alexey rolled his eyes. "What _kind_ of metal?"

"I don't know! Your favorite."

"I'm just asking because none of the steel ones are idols."

"Oh," said Vasilisa, unsheathing various other knives in turn to find each in an advanced state of decay. "...can we turn one into one?"

"What, like, bind a spirit ourselves? To a steel knife?"

"Sure. Is it hard?"

Alexey grimaced at the memory of the most recent spirit-binding he was party to. It was a funeral he attended at the age of six, officiated by his mother. She had made a contract with the deceased that upon her death, one of her bones would become an idol for the disease spirit that was killing her. Like most Ryzhaya rites, this was considered very unnatural and unclean within the local religious canon, and the controversy it stirred up had deepened the stigma of the Ryzhaya name to its present state, leading directly to the predicament Alexey and his friends faced today.

"It's... kind of a drag," he sighed. "I don't think we could pull one off right now. You need a sick person, and a way to treat their sickness."

"So, like, when we take our meds..."

Alexey frowned. "Yeah. When we take our meds, we're treating a disease. We could siphon off some of our depression and whatever into idols. If we had meds. Which we don't."

"Right. Assuming the meds even work, 'cause mine sure don't feel like they do. Still tired as hell all the time. Still can't focus."

"I _told_ you, start taking a stimulant already."

"I tried! None of 'em fucking work! They just give me akathisia."

"Okay, okay. Which knife?"

"Right, uhh, that one," said Vasilisa, pointing to a full-tang steel knife. "It's not like big or anything but it looks the sturdiest."

"The handle's wooden," replied Alexey obviously.

"I'll wrap it in leather. And it's got a tang. I'm taking it."

"Fine. Want anything else?"

"A drum."

"...of human skin?"

"What?"

"Never mind, it's a... Sump in-joke. Just take the one in the chest. I'd need to go looking for other ones."

The oval of stretched reindeer parchment in the chest had all the standard branching designs on it that befit a Samoyed drum, as well as some less traditional icons of what looked like mosquitos. These were detailed in what Vasilisa could only assume was blood. She wondered how the designs didn't fade or rub off. Magic? Or just high-effort dyeing with a good fixative?

"Isn't this, like, your family's most powerful drum? Being in the chest and all?"

"Hell if I know. I never paid attention to what drum my mother used when shamanizing. Big sand-colored oval either way."

"Okay. I'll take it. And lastly... I'll need a god."

Alexey raised an eyebrow. "A god?"

"Someone to shamanize to. You know. Someone who likes me? Please tell me someone likes me."

"I..." What was Alexey supposed to say here? "I think the Moon-Mother likes _me._ I mean, she never granted any of my wishes, I think, but they were dumb wishes anyway. She was probably just looking out for me. I've prayed to her a lot, and made sacrifices to her. Maybe..." He bit his lip meditatively. "Just shamanize to her, alright? Tell her you're a friend of mine and you're trying to help me."

Vasilisa sensed that Alexey was making an effort to be more vulnerable than usual here. "Alright, thanks. I totally will. I totally appreciate how... thank you. Really. Hug?"

Alexey nodded, and the two embraced tightly, heads over each other's shoulders. Vasilisa wasn't seriously expecting to die on her excursion, but she thought that just in case she did, she definitely wanted to hug both Alexey and Tosha first. And thank Sofia for all the help. _One bucket list item down, two to go,_ she thought. _Guess if you're about to die your bucket list's gotta be modest._

<div>They went back downstairs.</div>

"...not jellyfish, but it tastes the same and feels the same," Tosha was explaining to Sofia when the pair returned. "Or well it doesn't have much of a taste. But either way."

Sofia nodded politely and held up a finger. She turned to look at Alexey and Vasilisa as they arrived. "Hi. Did you find what you were looking for? Wait, is that _Mom's_ drum?"

"Yeah," said Vasilisa. "What's wrong with that?"

"Well, just... it's my drum now! I was gonna use it!"

While Vasilisa's first instinct was to dispute Sofia's claim to the drum, she realized it was a reasonable point. "Okay, I'm sorry, Sofia. May I borrow your drum? To go rescue Artemis and shamanize to the Moon-Mother?"

"Shamanize to the... how do you even know Artemis needs rescuing? You just _assume_ she's going to fail a simple grocery run? Is that what you think of your friend?"

"Hey," said Alexey, who did not like where this was going.

Vasilisa took a deep breath, and let it out. "Okay. Okay, fair. Can you ask the mosquitos how she's doing?"

"...alright," agreed Sofia. "Give me a moment." She closed her eyes.

Alexey and Vasilisa sat down in front of the fire while they waited.

"How's it going, Tosha?" asked Alexey.

"Good," replied Tosha. "I was explaining to Sofia what star jelly is. And how you can eat jelly fungi."

"Nice," said Vasilisa. "Can't wait for you to make that garlic-and-cilantro jelly shroom dish again. I could eat that for days."

"We'll have to forage," said Tosha seriously."

"Oh, yeah, can I hug you?"

"Not unless it's an emergency." Tosha didn't have anything against physical contact in principle, but still didn't enjoy the texture.

"It's an emergency," explained Vasilisa.

"Okay, then, yes."

Vasilisa squeezed Tosha's torso, pinning their arms to their sides. She rubbed her head against the crook of his neck some.

"Sorry," she said afterwards. "I just dunno what's gonna happen when I go look for Artemis, and I wanted to hug you and Alexey in case I die."

"That's fair," said Tosha.

Sofia opened her eyes and looked at her friends. "Okay, yes, she's in trouble. She's alone, but not moving, and her blood is scared."

The three non-mosquitos stared at her.

"Her blood tastes like she's scared, okay?" said Sofia frustratedly. "Or it's hot, or high-pressure, or really it could be a lot of things. But that's what the mosquitos said. Vasilisa, I'm sorry, you were right. It sounds like the anxiety spirit overwhelmed her. I think you might actually be able to handle this one on your own, too. You just need to accompany her back here."

Vasilisa stood up. "Alright. Thanks for the intel, and stuff. So, 'sit okay if I borrow your drum? I'm sorry I took it without asking."

Sofia sighed. "Yes, it's okay. Try not to beat it where the drawings are, though. They'll rub off."

Vasilisa nodded. "Thanks. Thanks for, like, helping out, and being a generally cool person, too. So far it's been real cool knowing you."

Sofia groaned. She understood exactly why she was hearing this. "Just get her and come back! You'll be _fine._"

<div>Vasilisa smiled, and gave a mock salute before disappearing out the door.</div>
