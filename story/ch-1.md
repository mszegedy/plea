_Moon-Mother, please take my soul._  
_It is scratched. It is worthless._  
_It is all I have to give you._  
_You keep the souls of so many_  
_who never should have lost them._  
_If you need names I can give them._  
_The girl who died right here because she didn't believe she could be one._  
_Her friend, who gave her life to a spirit she'd never meet and then swam into the ocean._  
_My once-friend, who went to prove himself in a pointless war so he could be respected._  
_The girl across the ocean who did nothing but sing for her village and got harrassed for it._  
_I can keep naming them for you._  
_They didn't deserve to die and I didn't deserve to live._  
_So please. I will give you my soul now._  
_I want to trade._

But though her gaze was fixed that night on the matchbox house in the hills of Keleykh, though she could not possibly have misheard his desperate entreaty, the new year found him in a hospital bed, rather than the Moon-Mother's frozen embrace. His sleeves had been cut away with fabric scissors and replaced with gauze, but the rest of his clothing remained intact, soaked through with at least three individual strata of bloodstains. Where his skin wasn't stained yellow with iodine, or caked with dry blood, or broken by new scar tissue and sutures, it was nearly translucent quartz sand, detailed with even starker white criss-crosses. His jeans, out of great sympathy for his skin, were in a similar condition, but his oversized hoodie remained far more loyal to its job of hiding everything and anything at all interesting about him in a sea of black, even despite its newly sleeveless nature.

Keleykh General Hospital was a reasonably competent establishment, but being located in a remote big city, their emergency ward was overburdened and understaffed. Alexey Pankratyevich Balandin was lucky to have a bed, and admitted to himself that it was a comfortable place to wake up to another day of continuing to have to live his life.

He tried sitting up. He didn't feel completely awake yet, but he already felt his attention and willpower being sapped by unwelcome sensations from his arms. He bore the pain with some pride; it was what he had been going for, after all, and he refused to feel sorry for it. But they were much more itchy than painful, especially where the gauze had clotted to the _inside_ of a wound, and that was just terrible. And underneath the smell of iodine and alcohol, he could smell rotting blood, which brought back more than a few unpleasant memories. His head swam a little. He considered going back to sleep.

He took stock of the room. In typical Keleykhsky fashion, the furniture was a network of wooden plank boxes supported by rusting brass. The walls were papered over with something pastel and floral and peeling, and he had the luxury of his very own door, with a small, rectangular window of wavy glass. He had been in this ward several times before, for broadly similar reasons, but he'd always just had a curtain. He had had no idea there even _were_ closed-off rooms.

A shadow passed over the door's window, and a moment later, the sound of the doorknob shook all remaining stupor out of his senses and attempted to kick his heart into a higher gear, an action vetoed at the last moment by his common sense. _This will be a nurse. They are not dangerous. They can help._

"Hello? Alexey Balandin? You're awake?"

"Yeah," he replied. "Sorry."

"No, no, you're no trouble at all! Alexey, your mother is here to see you. Shall I let her in?"

His heart overrode the veto and put all its power into supplying his brain with the oxygen necessary to process the implications of this. He came up blank. He hadn't seen his mother in… three years? And they had left on some of the worst possible terms. She had little means of finding out that he was here, and more to the point, she had _no_ means of _caring_ that he was here. As far as he knew, he was effectively disowned.

On account of turning out to be a guy. His bad.

"Uhhhh… sure. Let her in."

He thought about what he might have to lose from this. …nothing? He couldn't think of anything.

His mother slipped into the room and glid to his bedside. While she was a fearsome woman both in concept and reality, her wrinkled brow and stout, chubby physique betraying both a lack of vulnerability and a history of winning her battles, this was another side of her, where she masked it all for the sake of winning over her family.

It meant that she wasn't mad at him.

"Alyosha?"

"…hi. Mother."

The last he remembered, her hair had been sandy blonde, losing more of its pigmentation with each summer. Now it was thick with dye, patterned after her bloodline's namesake auburn. While legally none of the family had borne the name for the past century, and it had acquired a somewhat derogatory status in the modern social environment of Keleykh, there was no name that any stranger would have dared to refer to her by other than Sofia Nikolaevna Ryzhaya.

"I've been worried about you."

It had been nearly four years.

"…thanks."

"Look at you! I let you leave for a few years, and you get this fat? Come back home. I'll make you some nice, healthy mushroom stew. You can stop eating fast food and shaved ice."

"I'm paying rent on an apartment in the hills." (Also, he was making his own meals most days. But mentioning it would have escalated the argument too quickly.)

"I know. It's one of those little, freezing matchboxes, just waiting to catch fire from the poor plumbing. You sit here in this bed, your arms _covered_ in bloody gauze and scars, fat, pale, and utterly miserable. Is this what you wanted, Alyosha? Is this the grand life without me that you were looking for?"

"Why are you even here? What do you care?"

"I'm your _mother,_ Alyosha, of _course_ I care."

"Bullshit. You didn't—you—it's been _four years._ And you just… why do I even bother talking to you? You just want me to do what you want. And you dangle food and shelter in front of me like—"

His careful rhetorical poise now broken, Alyosha struggled to prioritize every relevant thought from the past four years and arrange them into sentences. He knew this was an argument he couldn't win, but what else could he do but keep fighting?

"Of course I want you to do what I want! What mother doesn't want her child to listen to her? What, you think I will just stand by and watch you freeze to death in that house? What mother does that?"

"You were completely fine doing it for four years!"

"So, you _wanted_ to move back in? Because the impression _I_ got was—"

"No, I didn't! And I still don't! But now you're here. And you weren't here before, so, what changed?"

"…well, I suppose I'll tell you, then. We'd already be discussing it if you weren't so argumentative.

"I'm dying."
