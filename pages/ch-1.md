_Moon-Mother, please take my soul._  
_It is scratched. It is worthless._  
_It is all I have to give you._  
_You keep the souls of so many_  
_who never should have lost them._  
_If you need names I can give them._  
_The girl who died right here because she didn't believe she could be one._  
_Her friend, who gave her life to a spirit she'd never meet and then swam into the ocean._  
_My once-friend, who went to prove himself in a pointless war so he could be respected, and never came home._  
_The girl across the ocean who did nothing but sing for her village and then get harrassed for it, and decided it was too much._  
_I can keep naming them for you._  
_They didn't deserve to die and I didn't deserve to live._  
_So please. I will give you my soul now._  
_I want to trade._
