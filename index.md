title: Plea to the Moon-Mother
author: Maria Szegedy

I was inspired by [*Pact*](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/) by John C. McCrae (aka Wildbow). I wish it did some things differently and I have issues with McCrae as an author, but there are valuable concepts in the story. I am therefore writing an adaptation. It is to put all of the feelings into words that I normally don't; in other words, it is a vent. Instead of being set in suburban Ontario, it is set where my nightmares are, a synthesis of Western Siberia and especially traumatic places I've lived, with confusing and scary post-post-apocalyptic elements. In this case, I decided to specifically combine Salekhard and Berkeley, because I have not at all forgiven Berkeley for everything that has happened to me and my friends, and Salekhard is in a geographically similar situation and a place I think about often. There is some irony in placing Berkeley in Russia, but I'd rather my story speak for itself in that respect.

*Plea* is therefore set in "Keleykh". It is supposed to be both scarier and happier than *Pact*. Only time will tell if I accomplished that.
