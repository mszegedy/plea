> Plea to the Moon-Mother is about a small group of queer people living in a world that melts Siberian folklore into the choking mundanity of surviving deep in Russia's periphery.

â€” Thalber Mitaclau, my friend

I was inspired by [*Pact*](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/) by John C. McCrae (aka Wildbow). I wish it did some things differently and I have issues with McCrae as an author, but there are valuable concepts in the story. I am therefore writing an adaptation. 

In Berkeley and in Western Siberia live both people I care about and people who have killed people I care about. So I still visit these places and people in my nightmares, because I haven't forgiven them, and haven't forgiven myself. There are worlds of tragedy there that I have experienced that I haven't properly been able to express in any other way. So, I am expressing them here. _Plea to the Moon-Mother_ is set in a blend of Berkeley and Salekhard: Keleykh. The similarities go beyond both being located inside oceanic bays, and I hold that there is deep irony in placing Berkeley in Russia. But I'd rather my story speak for itself in that respect.

_Plea to the Moon-Mother_ is supposed to be both scarier and happier than *Pact*. Only time will tell if I accomplished that.
